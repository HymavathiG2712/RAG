# Semantic RAG Pipeline Builder

Data Extraction and Chunking: Extracted text and images from PDFs and DOC files, followed by semantic chunking using NLTK to create meaningful data segments.
Semantic Representation: Generated embeddings for document chunks using a sentence transformer model to enable semantic understanding.
Similarity and Retrieval Foundation: Performed cosine similarity analysis between chunks, laying the groundwork for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
