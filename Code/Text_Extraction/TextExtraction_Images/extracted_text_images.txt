5. BRING A PICNIC BLANKET AND
PACKED COOLER (SEE ITEMS ABOVE)

so you have healthy food available when it’s time to eat.

AT THE GAS STATION / AIRPORT SHOP

Sometimes a convenience store is your only option. No big deal. PN coaches’ advice:
Reach for veggies like carrot sticks and pre-made salads first.
Beyond that...

6. AIM FOR BETTER, NOT PERFECT.

8. MAKE THE MOST OF MEAL OFFERINGS

(they usually include nuts/olives/cheese/

IN A HOTEL

10. CONSIDER BOOKING A ROOM WITHA KITCHENETTE.

11. HEAD TO THE NEAREST GROCERY STORE
and stock up on boxed salad, baby veggies, hummus, deli meat, and fruit.

IF YOU DON'T HAVE A KITCHEN...

12. ASK THE HOTEL TO EMPTY THE
MINI-BAR FRIDGE SO YOU CAN USE IT
FOR HEALTHY SNACKS.

13. MAKE COACH KRISTA’S COFFEE MAKER OATMEAL:

Pour dry oats in the paper cup, run the hot water,
let it sit. Stir in some protein powder if desired.

AT RESTAURANTS / CONFERENCES

These meals can be heavy, but there’s usually a workaround. Besides,
as long as you get workouts in, it shouldn't do much harm.

14. DON’T AIM FOR PERFECTION;
JUST PICK THE MENU ITEM THAT’S BEST FOR YOU

15. GET CREATIVE

E.g. ask them to double the grilled chicken
in your pasta or on your sandwich.

16. ASK FOR MORE GARNISHES

Lettuce, cabbage, cherry tomatoes,
orange slices, etc.

17. LOOK FOR BUILD-YOUR-OWN-MEAL RESTAURANTS
(Pret A Manger, Chipotle, Qdoba, etc.)

18. MAKE A PN-FRIENDLY FAST FOOD MEAL

Be SO,

CHICKEN
FRUIT
SANDWICH SALAD

oO

ON LONGER STAYS

19. MAKE YOUR PLAN

e Pre-order groceries from a local store
or service like Grocery Gateway

e Research the nearest grocery store
and how/when you'll get there

e Pre-order meals from

a local delivery service

e Get restaurant menus in

advance and decide what you'll order

20. SHIP FOOD AND EQUIPMENT TO YOUR DESTINATION

Staying at a hotel for a while?
Mail yourself a box of cheap gadgets
and snacks so you're set for the duration.
e Cutting knife
e Cutting board
e Shaker bottle
e Non-perishable items from
the snack tote list above

CHECK YOUR HEAD
Have some conversations with yourself about your journey.

21. DECIDE WHETHER YOU’LL STICK TO YOUR
HEALTHY HABITS OR TAKE A TEMPORARY BREAK.
Either way is good as long as it’s a conscious choice.

22. AIM FOR “BETTER” INSTEAD OF “PERFECT”.
This helps you avoid the f*ck it mentality.

23. HUNGER IS NOT AN EMERGENCY.
It's OK to be hungry for a couple hours
if you don’t like your food options.

24. WHAT ARE YOUR "MINIMUMS"?
E.g. at least 1 serving of greens a day,
2 workouts a week, etc.

25. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
YOU CAN ALWAYS FALL BACK ON
THE SIMPLE STUFF:

Eat slowly and mindfully until satisfied (80 percent full).
