www.crcpress.comThe Mediterranean Way of EatingNutrition
Scientific evidence accumulated over decades validates the idea that a plant-based 
dietary pattern, such as the traditional Mediterranean way of eating, promotes 
health and plays an important role in risk reduction and prevention of several 
chronic diseases. One of the great advantages of the Mediterranean diet is that it 
can be easily adopted by other cultures because it is flexible and highly palatable. 
The Mediterranean Way of Eating: Evidence for Chronic Disease Prevention 
and Weight Management offers evidence-based information about an enjoyable, 
healthy way of eating that has stood the test of time, along with practical suggestions 
for incorporating the Mediterranean diet into your daily life.
The first part of the book provides a brief history of the Mediterranean region and 
its different dietary influences. It discusses shared and unique foods in the coastal 
regions, and recent influences of processed foods and fast foods. It also presents 
scientific information on critical nutrients (macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, 
phytochemicals, antioxidants, and fiber) in foods found in the Mediterranean 
diets, how they function in the body, and why they are essential to health. The 
authors review the major chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers, and examine how a Mediterranean-
style diet may help reduce risk or prevent these diseases.
The second part of the book addresses the protective effects of foods and food 
components, discussing how Mediterranean diets may confer health benefits for 
reducing disease risk and managing weight. It examines the evidence-based health 
benefits for each of the food groups—such as fruits, vegetables, grains, fish, meat, 
dairy products, plus alcohol—along with suggestions for using the foods as part 
of a healthy diet. The last part of the book focuses on how to move toward a 
Mediterranean-style diet in your own life, eating at home or dining out, offering 
effective strategies for implementing the dietary changes.

Foreword
Good nutrition is based on a pattern of eating nutritious foods in appropriate 
amounts—not too much or too little. This book on Mediterranean diet patterns 
leads the way toward the establishment of healthy eating habits and the promotion 
of sound lifestyle behaviors that minimize the chronic diseases so common in the 
Western world. 
For example, heart disease and stroke combined are now the leading cause of 
death and disability worldwide, claiming more than 17 million lives per year. Those 
who survive an event frequently suffer with crippling disabilities and symptoms. 
Alarming increases in obesity and diabetes are an important factor contributing to 
this growing global burden of cardiovascular disease. Experts agree that improving 
diets is an effective first step toward preventing heart disease and stroke as well as 
preventing obesity, diabetes, and certain forms of cancer. In a landmark decision, the 
United Nations, working through the World Health Organization, has set a goal to 
reduce by 25% the premature mortality caused by these disorders by the year 2025. 
To achieve this goal heightened interest worldwide now focuses on how a healthy 
diet can contribute to improved quality of life, reduction of disease, and longevity.
For years epidemiologists and others have been interested in a Mediterranean diet 
and how its foods, and their nutrients, might relate to the observed longevity and 
healthy outcomes of certain populations in Mediterranean countries. Results from 
a series of important trials now support the benefits of a Mediterranean pattern of 
eating to prevent and reduce the prevalence of heart attacks and stroke. The Lyon 
(France) Heart Study showed that individuals of a high-risk population who had sur -
vived a cardiovascular event did better when they adhered to a Mediterranean-style 
diet. Recently the PREDIMED trial (Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease 
with a Mediterranean Diet) confirmed that a Mediterranean diet, supplemented with 
extra–virgin olive oil or certain nuts, effectively reduced the occurrence of a first 
cardiovascular event. A systematic review of dietary factors and coronary heart dis -
ease has ranked a Mediterranean way of eating as most likely to provide protection 
against coronary heart disease because of satisfaction and adherence to the diet. In 
the face of abundant evidence supporting the benefits of adhering to a Mediterranean 
diet it remains essential to understand the concepts and eating patterns required for 
its implementation.
This book provides the tools and core elements needed to understand and adopt 
a healthy way of eating that can reduce the risk of suffering the devastating conse -
quences of a heart attack or stroke. Knowledge is fundamental to any successful 
change in lifestyle if it is put into practice. The authors have written a thoughtful, 
comprehensive text which will be an asset to anyone with a serious interest in devel -
oping a healthy lifestyle and changing their eating habits. Years of experience and xvi Foreword
research combined with data from the most recent trials have been distilled into a 
readable, understandable primer, which provides the reader with valuable informa -
tion. I highly recommend this thoughtful review of a Mediterranean diet and urge 
all to make a healthy diet and lifestyle their fundamental personal choice and life -
long commitment.

Preface
No doubt exists that what we eat has an enormous impact on our health. Solid 
scientific evidence accrued over many decades validates the premise that a plant- 
based dietary pattern, such as the traditional Mediterranean way of eating, not only 
promotes health but also plays a substantial role in risk reduction and prevention 
of several chronic debilitating diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, 
and certain cancers. In addition, this type of dietary pattern can benefit those who 
already have one of these serious medical conditions by reducing symptoms, slowing 
disease progression, and increasing the length of time in which to feel good enough 
to enjoy life. Research studies continue to support the widespread health benefits of 
the Mediterranean dietary pattern.
The Mediterranean dietary pattern encompasses several variations on a basic 
theme of commonly consumed foods rich in nutrients and beneficial phytochemicals. 
High amounts of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds are types 
of foods common to the diets of most nations of the Mediterranean Sea basin. Olive 
oil, especially virgin or extra-  virgin olive oil, is also a prominent feature in many of 
these cultures. Different meats may be used in these nations, but meat consumption 
is generally low compared to plant food intakes, although various kinds of fish and 
seafood are eaten in moderation. Cheese and some fermented dairy products, such 
as yogurt, are popular in many regions, and wine, especially red wine, accompanies 
meals in some populations of the region.
One of the great advantages of the highly palatable Mediterranean way of eating 
is that it can be transferred fairly easily to non-  Mediterranean nations, where its use 
can contribute to better health indices and increased longevity of the new popula -
tions. The flexibility of a Mediterranean-  style diet, as opposed to a rigid diet, also 
contributes to the ease of adoption by many different cultures.
This book is written for both general readers and medical professionals interested 
in health promotion and disease prevention and treatment. It is not a “diet” book 
that hops on the bandwagon of the latest fad diets or miracle foods. You will not 
find “testimonials” by selected people or results only from one small study to back 
up health claims. What you will find is good, sound information about an enjoyable, 
healthy way of eating that has stood the test of time, along with practical suggestions 
on how to incorporate this type of dietary pattern into your usual daily life.
The book is divided into 18 chapters followed by five appendices containing addi -
tional pertinent and practical information. Section I deals with Mediterranean diet 
patterns and the nutrients they provide. The first chapter provides a brief history of 
the Mediterranean region and the many different influences over the centuries that 
helped to shape food preferences and methods of food preparation. Chapter 2 focuses 
on both the shared and unique foods found in the coastal regions of Mediterranean 
nations. Recent influences of processed foods and fast foods and their effects on tra -
ditional Mediterranean diets also are discussed. Because the content of Chapter 3 is 
scientifically based, some readers may wish to go directly to Chapter 4 and pick up xviii Preface
the details of individual nutrients as they proceed to other chapters. Chapter 3 pres -
ents information on the macronutrients (i.e., carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) and 
their roles in providing energy for the body’s needs. In addition, carbohydrate as a 
source of sugars and starches, protein as a source of amino acids, and fat as a source 
of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are discussed. A review of vitamins, miner -
als, phytochemicals, antioxidant molecules, and fiber found in plant foods highlights 
their importance in health maintenance and disease prevention. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 
discuss obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, diet- 
related cancers, and other diseases and how a Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern 
can have a major impact on preventing, or reducing risk, of these serious medi -
cal conditions.
The protective effects of certain foods and food components in Mediterranean 
diets are covered in Section II. Chapter 7 provides a brief overview relating how 
Mediterranean diets may confer benefits to health that reduce chronic disease risk 
and manage weight. Chapters 8 through 16 examine the evidence-  based health ben -
efits of foods in each of the food groups plus alcohol. These chapters also present 
practical suggestions for using these foods in one’s diet.
Section III focuses on the big picture of eating the Mediterranean way and how 
to move toward a Mediterranean-  style diet in your own life. Chapter 17 addresses 
how readily a Mediterranean dietary pattern can be transferred to the U.S. and other 
non- Mediterranean cultures. Other issues discussed include the ease of maintaining 
this way of eating, vegetarian diets, eating out, and effective strategies for imple -
menting dietary changes and modifications. Chapter 18 summarizes the key dietary 
components that make Mediterranean diets so beneficial to health and longevity, 
including the total diet, the slower lifestyle, family-  centered meals, and regular phys -
ical activities.
Appendix A provides a table of the types and amounts of dietary fiber found in 
common plant foods. Appendix B offers a sampling of recipes that are representa -
tive of the foods and ingredients commonly used in most Mediterranean cuisines. A 
nutritional analysis accompanies each recipe. Appendix C lists a variety of books on 
Mediterranean foods and cooking. Appendix D gives a number of websites related 
to topics covered in this book. Appendix E presents a glossary of terms used in 
this volume.
We hope this book inspires you, the reader, to begin moving toward a Mediterranean 
dietary pattern so that you are able to enjoy the advantages of good health and long

Mediterranean Dietary Patterns3
1What Is a 
Mediterranean Diet?
Common Components 
in Diverse Dietary 
Patterns Promote 
Health and Long Life
INTRODUCTION
Many books have been written about the benefits of what is generally known as 
the Mediterranean diet. Most books have focused on recipes and meal plans. This 
book offers a wider scope that emphasizes the health  benefits that the Mediterranean 
people may derive from the nutrients of the foods consumed in this region. This book 
also provides a modest amount of the nutritional science lying behind the observa -
tions that the nutrient-  rich dietary patterns of the Mediterranean countries contribute 
to good health and demonstrates how these eating patterns can be readily adapted 
to non-  Mediterranean populations throughout the world. The historical changes in 
improving food availability in Mediterranean populations has led to the consump -
tion of diverse foods that reduce the chances of having low or even deficient intakes 
of one or more nutrients. In our busy lives, we can utilize a wide variety of whole -
some, delicious foods the Mediterranean way and enrich ourselves by living longer, 
feeling better, and reducing the burden of chronic diseases.
The focus here is placed on the beneficial effects on the health of those 
Mediterraneans who consume what is known as the traditional diet based on plant foods, 
fish and other seafood, olives, cheese, and red wine, plus limited servings of animal 
and dairy products. This type of diet exerts a strong preventive role against the devel -
opment of the major chronic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascu -
lar diseases, diet-  related cancers, and others. Because the basic Mediterranean diet 
can be transferred to other parts of the world, this eating pattern provides foods that 
as a whole can serve in the promotion of global health and the prevention of disease.
The basis of a healthy diet is a variety of foods that provide all the essential nutri -
ents and phytochemicals (nonnutrient plant molecules) but not excessive amounts 
of calories. Recently, dietary pattern analysis, as opposed to assessing individual 
nutrients or foods, has been used as an alternative approach to understanding the 4 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
relationships between the usual diet and health of a population. The Mediterranean 
pattern of eating has been studied using this method with respect to cardiovascu -
lar disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and other chronic diseases, and it has yielded 
important findings that establish the contributions of this dietary pattern to the pro -
motion of health and the prevention or delay of these diseases. These diseases are 
covered in Chapters 4 through 6.
Highlight: The basis of a healthy diet is a variety of foods that provide all the 
essential nutrients and phytochemicals but not excessive amounts of calories.
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO DIVERSE 
MEDITERRANEAN DIETARY PATTERNS
One Mediterranean diet does not exist for the entire region, but rather many variants 
of the Mediterranean eating pattern exist in the nations that border the Mediterranean 
Sea. Although the pattern of eating is similar in all these nations, variations in 
dietary patterns do exist. Nations within this region differ with respect to culture, 
tradition, religion, soil and agricultural capabilities, and socioeconomic status, all of 
which affect dietary patterns. See Figure 1.1 for a map of the Mediterranean region.
At the intersection of the Old World—Asia, Europe, and North Africa—the 
Mediterranean Sea served as a prominent navigational route for trade and exchange 
in earlier times. The spice trade is one important example that enriched the culinary 
traditions of most Mediterranean nations. Also, the influence at different times of 
Greek, Roman, Byzantine or Ottoman, and Moorish cultures on food preferences 
and ways of preparation has had impacts on practically all Mediterranean countries. 
Most people have lived near the coast or in fishing villages at the edge of the sea, and 
most communication had historically been by way of watercraft. Climate and geog -
raphy vary in and among these countries, such as from coastal areas to inland and 
mountainous regions, which affects the types of foods that can be grown. Religion 
also has an impact on food choices.
Highlight: One Mediterranean diet does not exist for the entire region, but 
rather many variants of the Mediterranean eating pattern exist in the nations that 
border the Mediterranean Sea.
This diversity of eating patterns, however, is strongly based on plant-  rich diets, 
including fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. When animal 
foods are consumed, the emphasis is on readily available fish and seafood and less 
so on red meats, in part because of limited land for animal husbandry. Local fishers 
for millennia have caught fish and other seafood, but their consumption historically 
has been limited to proximity to the coastal ports. Most plant foods in traditional 
Mediterranean diets also have been produced locally, but exceptions occur when 5 What Is a Mediterranean Diet?

poor soil, weather, topography, or other adverse conditions curtailed panagricul -
ture. A few representative foods of the Mediterranean dietary pattern are given in 
Table 1.1.
Another similarity in dietary patterns of the Mediterranean region is the com -
mitment to family activities, such as sitting down daily for a leisurely paced meal 
with conversation. Only recently have fast foods, heavily processed foods, and other 
changes in the food supply had major impacts on the traditional diets and lifestyles 
of peoples in the Mediterranean nations. Family values, roles of women in the work -
force, and technological advances have helped hasten these changes, also observed 
in much of the rest of the world.
NUTRIENT NEEDS OF EARLY MEDITERRANEAN POPULATIONS
Early humankind likely needed large intakes of food to meet the energy needs of 
daily living in challenging environments. Protein consumption was probably low 
in most early cultures, although a few hunter–  gatherer types must have consumed 
large quantities of wild game and, hence, more animal protein than typical plant 
gatherers. Physical size in early cultures was typically much different from today; 
people were shorter, and they weighed less, as it was difficult to consume enough 
calories and protein to optimize growth (height) and support bodily needs. Despite 
early cultures being successful in survival and reproduction, they nevertheless had 
suboptimal growth and development. Muscular development, however, was consid -
ered to be optimal in these early times because of the physical demands of hunting; TABLE  1.1

gathering water, food, and wood for fires; and later farming, without the current 
availability of machines.
Overweight or obesity was probably nonexistent in early cultures and has only 
emerged as some populations became relatively wealthy. Survival of the fittest back 
then related mainly to both physical and mental well-  being—and obese individuals, 
if any existed, had little likelihood of surviving.
MEDITERRANEAN FOODS AND THEIR COMPONENTS 
CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHY DIETS
The mixing of a variety of healthy food items in the same meals over time leads to 
a healthy diet. In early cultures, the healthy mix of foods was learned by trial and 
error. These diets contained major carbohydrates from plant sources, protein pre -
dominantly from plant sources such as legumes, fat mainly from olive oil but to a 
lesser extent also from fish and animal products, and micronutrients (i.e., minerals 
and vitamins) from all food items but especially plants. Phytochemicals were pro -
vided by a wide variety of plant sources in the diet. Alcohol use was highly variable 
in the dietary patterns of early cultures, but likely only small amounts, if any, were 
consumed.  The classic report by Christakis (1965) initiated the study of the health 
benefits of Mediterranean dietary patterns.
The emphasis on plant foods in a Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern distinguishes 
this diet from most Western-  style diets, which are more heavily based on animal 
foods. The typical plant foods include fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, 
and seeds, as well as herbs and spices. Figure 1.2 presents the Mediterranean Diet 
Pyramid by the Oldways Preservation and Trust organization (http://oldwayspt.org) 
and illustrates the foods found in Mediterranean diets in a multitier system: The low -
est tier contains foods consumed in the greatest quantity each day, and the second 
and subsequent tiers list foods consumed in progressively less amounts each day. 
Animal foods are typically consumed in low-  to- moderate amounts and in modest 
serving sizes; cheeses largely replace liquid milk. Olive oil is the preferred oil used 
for cooking, on breads, and in salads. Wine is typically consumed at a meal in many 
Mediterranean diets. This traditional general pattern of eating was accompanied by a 
fairly active lifestyle, but modern devices have reduced energy expenditures in daily 
activities, and the intakes of more sugar, fat, and fast foods have partially eroded 
the health benefits of Mediterranean eating patterns in these populations. Figure 1.3 
depicts the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s healthy eating plan, called MyPlate.

NUTRIENT COMPONENTS OF HEALTHY DIETS
The components of healthy diets, while somewhat variable in terms of specific foods, 
contain similar food items that provide the essential nutrients in sufficient amounts 
to support life. Macronutrients, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and micronutrients, 
vitamins, and minerals, along with phytochemicals, all contribute significantly to 
human health and well-  being (see Table 1.2).  The types, amounts,  and variety of 
foods we consume that contain, or do not contain, certain nutrients, however, can 
affect our health either in positive ways or in negative ways.
Further information on the nutrient and phytochemical components of healthy 
diets, such as a Mediterranean-  style diet, is discussed in Chapter 3.

LIFE EXPECTANCY ACROSS THE MILLENNIA
Although difficult to ascertain age of death with no records of early culture, it is 
known that people long ago lived much shorter lives than today in most developed 
countries. Infant and child death rates were likely high. Bacterial and viral diseases

by sufficiently good nutrition (i.e., diets with more high-  quality protein and micro -
nutrients). So, these cultures were successful because enough children survived 
to adulthood, and procreation maintained population numbers for continuation of 
the group.
Longevity in the Western world is now quite high, and several nations of the 
Mediterranean region are among the longest in life expectancy of the world, espe -
cially Sardinia, only falling below Japanese living in Okinawa, and possibly a few 
other countries. Medical and technological advances, of course, have contributed to 
increasing longevity, but lifestyle, including diet and physical activity, also play an 
important part. Chronic diseases have replaced infectious diseases as the major kill -
ers today in most developed countries. These chronic diseases have reduced rates in 
Mediterranean populations:
• Heart disease
• Other cardiovascular diseases
• Diet-  related cancers
• Obesity
• Hypertension
• Type 2 diabetes mellitus
• Metabolic syndrome
Chapters 4 through 6 discuss how healthy eating patterns, such as the traditional 
Mediterranean way of eating, can reduce substantially the risks of chronic debilitat -
ing diseases and lead to a longer and healthier life.
Highlight: Several nations of the Mediterranean region are among the longest in 
life expectancy of the world, especially Sardinia.
Lifetime expectancy currently varies among these nations, in part because 
of the different cultural settings and local diet customs of people living near the 
Mediterranean Sea. Poverty, of course, has a major impact on health and survival. 
Life expectancy of the coastal populations is considered to be higher than of the 
inland residents because of the healthier fish-  based diet near the seashore compared 
to the more meat-  based diet of those away from the coast. Chapter 7 introduces the 
types of foods that have the biggest impacts on diet-  related chronic diseases, and 
then Chapters 8 through 16  follow up with coverage of important aspects of the con -
sumption of specific foods that have favorable impacts on health.
SUMMARY
A healthy diet consists of many specific nutrients and phytochemicals that are 
needed for growth and to maintain body functions, including reproduction, ambula -
tion, immune resistance to infection, and other functions. Early humankind often 
was not successful in consuming sufficient amounts of nutrition-  rich foods that 11 What Is a Mediterranean Diet?
permitted survival. Early cultures that did survive typically lived for only a few 
decades and “eked out” their existence, in part because of suboptimal nutrition. In 
most Mediterranean dietary patterns, all the essential nutrients in sufficient amounts 
are provided by the typical foods to support healthy lives throughout the life cycle. 
Consumption of these substantial and nutrient-  complete diets by these nations that 
border the sea has been largely responsible for their historical success.
Mediterranean patterns of eating are representative of the most beneficial diets 
known to humankind. Because they included so many plant foods, including fruits, 
vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, they historically provided just 
enough calories each day to meet the needs of energy expenditure in daily activities. 
The major benefit in terms of calories was that individuals did not become obese, as 
occurs so frequently now in the United States and many other nations. So, calorie 
control was built into the typical eating pattern with little other constraint on food 
intake needed.
Adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern has been demonstrated to improve 
health and reduce mortality from many chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular 
diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and diet-  related cancers. Chronic disease rates are 
generally lower in Mediterranean populations than in other Western nations.
A Mediterranean-  style diet can be easily transferred to other nations of the world. 
See Chapters 17 and 18 for further support of such dietary transfers to other nations 
and for practical approaches to incorporate a Mediterranean dietary pattern within 
your own lifestyle.13
2Dietary Patterns of the 
Mediterranean Nations
Then and Now
INTRODUCTION
Several Mediterranean countries have their own unique eating styles, yet many com -
mon food items exist in all the nations bordering this major sea basin (Table 2.1). 
Some unique food preferences also occur. Traditional Mediterranean diets apply 
mainly to the coastal regions—the littoral edge—of these nations because of prox -
imity to the sea and its bounty of seafood. People who live in inland regions have less 
access to fish and other seafood, and they may consume more red meats and other 
animal products. The inlands are usually mountainous or may not be conducive to 
growing cereal grains, so the diets of these populations are generally different from 
those of coastal people. Low rainfall is also common in lands away from the coast.
For purposes of this discussion, the nations of the Mediterranean region have been 
divided into four parts to demonstrate both the shared and the unique foods consumed 
in these four geographic regions. Historic contributions to the diets of the region 
spring from the Minoan, Greek, and Egyptian cultures and later from the Phoenicians 
and Romans. The diverse food intakes of the nations of the four regions are listed in 
Table 2.2 according to major food items: western, Adriatic, eastern, and North African.
Each of the four regions is highlighted with specific food preferences of the 
nations of the region. Because people in the United States have for many years 
adopted the food habits of western or eastern Mediterranean regions, these nations 
receive somewhat more coverage in this book. This emphasis is based on the ready 
transfer of dishes and ways of food preparation that have resulted from successive 
immigrant populations from Mediterranean nations to the United States and other 
nations over the last 100 years or more.
Although precise data are not available, estimated intakes of calories or energy 
have been made for those who consume a typical Mediterranean diet and a typical 
U.S. diet in the United States (Table  2.3). In Crete and Greece, for example, the 
energy contributions give a different and possibly healthier breakdown of calories 
from the different food groups than for the United States.
REGIONS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN 
AND THEIR TRADITIONAL DIETS
Each region is introduced by the major protein sources commonly consumed in the 
nations of the region. Because practically all Mediterranean diets now use tomatoes 14 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
or tomato sauce as part of their daily fare, these populations also consume good 
amounts of vitamin C, vitamin A precursors, phytochemicals, water, and several 
other healthful nutrients. Tomatoes, it should be noted, are new foods brought back 
from the New World, but they have been widely incorporated into the diets of the 
Mediterranean countries. Other foods and their major nutrient contributions also 
are identified for the nations of the four regions. These traditional Mediterranean 
ways of eating, together with other healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as ample physi -
cal activity, play a major role in helping to prevent many of the chronic diseases so 
prevalent in our world today.
Highlight: Because practically all Mediterranean diets now use tomatoes or 
tomato sauce as part of their daily fare, these populations consume good amounts 
of vitamin C, vitamin A precursors, phytochemicals, water, and several other 
healthful nutrients.
In addition, brief comments that relate to lifestyle, especially physical activity, 
of the nations in the four regions are offered. In the last part of the chapter, infor -
mation is presented on the recent changes in the traditional Mediterranean diets TABLE  2.1

that contribute to less-  healthy outcomes (i.e., greater obesity and increased inci -
dence rates of chronic diseases). Keep in mind that herbs and spices have been 
used traditionally in most of these nations to help preserve and enhance the taste 
or flavor of many customary foods. Portugal, part of the Iberian Peninsula along 
with Spain, is not included in this group of nations because it does not border on the 
Mediterranean Sea.
Western  region
Nations in this European western region include France, Italy, Malta, Monaco, 
Sardinia, and Spain. Figure 2.1 provides a map showing the geographic proximity of 
these countries. Diets here are high in fish and seafood, but inland people consume 
more meat than fish as protein sources.
France. Fish and other seafood are considered essential, but meats also may 
be consumed in the same meal in different courses.  Meals are traditionally 
wholesome and prepared fresh each day. Major foods incorporated in the 
diets of southern France are vegetables, fruits, grains, olive oil, cheeses, 
and nuts, which are often accompanied by red wine. Fresh breads and other 
grain foods are consumed each day. Meals only occasionally include rich 
sauces, such as aioli (mayonnaise and garlic) and are the exception rather 
than the rule. Dark-  green leafy vegetables and citrus fruits are eaten at one 
or more meals each day. Fruits, cheeses, and desserts typically are offered 
last. Desserts often are sweet, but cheese and bread or fruits also are served 
as desserts. Many wine choices are available at meals.
Italy. Italians eat most of the same foods consumed in France, but differences do 
exist, especially in preparation. More veal is consumed in the north, whereas 
more fish is consumed in the south. Pastas made from wheat grown in north -
ern Italy are coupled with seafood and vegetables. Tomatoes, first introduced 
to Italy from the New World, are widely used with pastas and in other dishes. 
Soups made with fish and other ingredients are popular, as are cheeses 
(e.g., ricotta), olive oil, spices, and fruits. Wine typically accompanies most 
meals. In Sicily, Italian cuisine has been influenced by earlier Arab occupation.
Malta. The inhabitants of this island nation consume much seafood as part of 
everyday meals. Meat, pasta, cheese, vegetables, nuts, and fruits are con -
sumed commonly. Lamb is especially popular, but it is eaten mainly on holi -
days and special occasions. Olive oil is a major component of Maltese cuisine.
Monaco. The people of Monaco, a principality, consume foods and dishes 
similar to those of France and northern Italy. The French and Italian prepa -
ration styles of fish and fresh vegetables are most popular here.
Sardinia. The island people of Sardinia eat much as other Italians, but they 
typically have lifestyles that are more active as a result of using older meth -
ods of agriculture. The Sardinians, for example, are among the longest-  lived 
people anywhere. Unlike most other Mediterranean people, however, they 
rely more on lean meats than seafood as their primary source of protein. The 
more active lifestyle of the Sardinians clearly offers them health benefits.17 Dietary Patterns of the Mediterranean Nations

Spain.  The Spanish diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, and nuts, in addition to 
cereals and fish and other protein sources. Citrus fruits are especially popu -
lar, as are breads, other wheat products, and rice. Dark greens are widely 
consumed. The cuisine of Southern Spain has been greatly influenced by the 
Moorish occupation of several centuries. The spice trade was also important 
historically in Spain, so spices are an integral part of meals. Post-  Columbian 
New World foods introduced by Spain include the potato, tomato, and choc -
olate. Tapas, small portions of food that contain fish or meat, are popular. 
Sugar-  laden pastries and other desserts rich in honey or syrup and nuts, 
which have resulted from Arab influence, are consumed in moderation.
AdriAtic region
Nations of the Adriatic European region include Albania; Croatia, including 
Dalmatia; Serbia and Montenegro; and Slovenia. A map of these countries is given 
in Figure 2.2. Balkan countries of the Adriatic arm of the Mediterranean Sea have 
both Muslim and Christian backgrounds, which influence eating habits. In general, 
eastern Adriatic nations have diets traditionally rich in beef, but fish and other sea -
food are consumed less frequently in this region.
Albania.  Inhabitants of Albania are predominantly Muslim, and they con -
sume, according to their food laws, no pork or alcohol. They eat a diet of 
traditional foods, including fish and other seafood, plus meats (goat, sheep) 
and fruits, vegetables, and grains. Olive oil is widely used. Because most 
inhabitants have limited economic means, their dietary intake tends to rely 
on a few staple foods, such as bread, rice, beans, and yogurt. Meat, being 
more costly, is consumed less frequently and usually in small amounts.
Croatia, including Dalmatia.  Meat, especially pork, soups with chicken or 
beef, potatoes, cheese, and vegetables typically are consumed inland, but 
fish and other seafood are eaten by coastal residents along with pastas, 
bread, and other carbohydrates.
Serbia and Montenegro.  Serbians eat more meat and dairy products than 
fish and other seafood, accompanied by breads, vegetables, and fruits. 
Peppers are a popular vegetable, and they are used in many prepared dishes. 
Customary foods include stews, cornbread, cheese, eggs, sweet desserts, 
and strong coffee.
Slovenia. The dietary patterns of Slovenians include foods similar to those of its 
Mediterranean neighbors in Croatia, but differences do exist. Most traditional 
dishes are made with wheat flour or other flours and potatoes and cabbage. 
Desserts may be eaten at special occasions. Wine is not usually consumed at 
regular meals, but it is often served at social events and ceremonies.
eAstern region
Countries in the eastern region include Cyprus, Greece, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, 
Turkey, and the Palestinian territories (West Bank and Gaza Strip). The map in 20 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Figure  2.3 shows the relationships of these nations in the eastern Mediterranean 
region. The people in these lands consume somewhat diverse diets. Fish and seafood 
are basic to eating habits in these nations, but some meats, particularly lamb, and 
their products are also popular. Many countries in this region drink thick coffee. 
In the Muslim countries, all-  day fasting occurs until nightfall during Ramadan.
The peoples of the Middle East (i.e., Israel, Lebanon, Palestine, and Syria) all 
consume falafel, hummus, tahini, and tabuleh, each with alternate spellings. Falafel 
is typically made from highly spiced, ground chickpeas (garbanzo beans), which 
are formed into small balls and deep-  fried. Hummus is also made from chickpeas, 
which are mashed and mixed with lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, and other season -
ings. Hummus is usually served as a dip with pieces of pita, or it may be served as a 
sauce. Tahini, a sesame seed paste, is sometimes added to hummus, or it can be used 
as a sauce to accompany falafel. Tabuleh consists of bulgur wheat that is typically 
mixed with chopped tomatoes, onions, parsley, mint, olive oil, and lemon juice, and 
it is usually served as a cold salad plate.
Cyprus.  This divided eastern Mediterranean Island exists under Greek (much 
of the island) and Turkish (north) rule and enjoys the diets of both of these 
nations (see the following material for specific foods). Nicosia, the capital 
city of both the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, is divided as well. 
Olives and olive oil are eaten with most meals, which also include fish or 
meat. Salads, vegetables, and yogurt also are consumed frequently.
Greece. The traditional Mediterranean diet still  holds sway in Greece. The 
Greeks typically have breads, olive oil, fruits, vegetables, red wine, fish, 
and other “fruits of the sea,” along with garlic, herbs, and nuts. Lamb and 
goat are popular meats. Eggplant dishes, including moussaka, are popu -
lar, as are Greek salads, which typically contain kalamata olives, feta 
cheese, and other ingredients. Vegetables or meats stuffed in grape leaves, 
known as dolmas, are also popular. Oranges, first derived from Asia; figs; 
and dates also have been historically important fruits to this cuisine. Many 
protein foods, especially fish, are prepared with tomato sauce and garlic. 
Olives and olive oil are consumed with most meals. The diets of the Greek 
islands, Crete, and to a considerable extent, Cyprus are similar except that 
the island populations typically have more fish and less red meat than those 
living on mainland Greece. With the exception of sheep and goats, animals 
remain difficult to raise on the mountainous lands of the isles. Greeks also 
consume rich desserts, such as baklava, and they enjoy their meals with 
family members and guests. Thick coffee and tea, in addition to alcoholic 
beverages, primarily wine, are consumed.
Israel. Fish, less red meat, and fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are con -
sumed in Israel, which produces much of its own fruits and vegetables.  
Olive oil and different types of bread routinely are consumed, along with 
rich desserts. Because of Jewish food laws from the Torah, porcine products 
and certain combinations of food items are not permitted, and specially 
prepared kosher foods are consumed by observant kashruth practitioners. 
Many Western foods, such as prepared frozen meals and other packaged 21 Dietary Patterns of the Mediterranean Nations

FIGURE 2.3  Eastern nations bordering the Mediterranean Sea.22 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
food, often are consumed, so that the traditional Mediterranean diet may, in 
effect, be diluted. Many of these nontraditional foods are kosher certified.
Lebanon. Lebanese cuisine is highly representative of the Mediterranean 
region as it contains all the basic foods, a variety of grains, vegetables, 
fruits, fish and other seafood, less red meat, olive oil, and some red wine. 
Fish and other seafood are more commonly consumed by those living in 
coastal cities and towns. Meats are barbecued, cooked with vegetables and 
rice, or in kibbe (meat and bulgur pie). The Lebanese consume many veg -
etarian dishes. Rice and vegetable dishes are popular, as are dishes cooked 
with olive oil, such as stuffed grape leaves and beans. Burghul (bulgur) 
wheat is used in the preparation of tabouli, one of the many popular dishes 
of this dietary pattern. Tahini sauce, made from ground sesame seeds, 
is added to many popular dishes, such as fish, falafel, and shawarma. 
Hummus, made from mashed chickpeas, is served as a vegetable dip with 
pita bread; a fava bean dip also is eaten with pita bread. Falafel is made of 
a mixture of grains, and it typically includes hummus and beans. Yogurt is 
used to make labneh, a breakfast item served with pita bread; labneh also 
may be eaten as a snack. Instead of dessert, fruits are typically eaten by the 
Lebanese after meals, including figs, oranges and other citrus fruits, apples, 
grapes, cherries, and peaches. Devout Muslims do not eat pork or drink 
alcoholic beverages.
The Palestinian Territories (West Bank and Gaza Strip). This emerging 
Muslim nation has similar eating habits as neighboring countries, but its 
generally low economic status suggests that dietary intakes are limited for 
most of the population. The main meal customarily is eaten between two 
and three o’clock in the afternoon. Specific food items are similar to those 
consumed by their Lebanese neighbors. Falafel  sandwiches are made with 
balls of deep-  fried hummus, and grilled lamb sandwiches or shawarma are 
also popular. Pita bread accompanies practically every meal. Lamb, egg -
plant, chicken, and rice dishes commonly are eaten. Sweet pastries, made 
with honey and almonds or pistachios, are often eaten. Drinking thick cof -
fee or tea is a major social activity, primarily for men.
Syria. The diets of Syrians and Lebanese are highly similar. Lamb is a popu -
lar but more expensive meat, so it is not consumed often by many people 
of low economic means. Chicken is also popular. Meat or chicken is eaten 
with side dishes of rice, chickpeas, other vegetables, and yogurt. Commonly 
eaten fruits include dates, figs, and plums. Olives and olive oil are widely 
used. Tea is a popular drink, but alcoholic beverages are only consumed on 
rare occasions, as they are forbidden by Islamic law.
Turkey. Coastal people consume fish and other seafood frequently, but red 
meats, such as lamb and goat, are preferred. Yogurt is also popular. Breads, 
fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and herbal seasonings remain 
part of the basic Mediterranean diet. Eggplant, rice, and sweet desserts are 
eaten widely. During Ramadan, Muslims “fast” during the daytime but 
“feast” on their favorite foods after sunset.23 Dietary Patterns of the Mediterranean Nations
north AfricAn region
Nations in the North African region include Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and 
Tunisia. Figure 2.4 presents a map of this region bordering the southern side of the 
Mediterranean Sea. Most populations of North Africa live near the coast, so that 
the traditional dietary patterns of the region still hold. North African populations 
are predominantly Muslim, and like Muslim peoples of the eastern Mediterranean 
region, they consume much less seafood and fish than those living in the western 
region. Animal meats are eaten only occasionally because they cannot be afforded. 
Red meats, such as sheep and goat, are popular, but fish and other seafood are less 
liked. Beef, although rarely consumed because of its high cost, is preferred over 
other protein sources. Goat milk also is consumed by some populations in the region. 
Egypt often has been categorized as part of the eastern region of the Mediterranean, 
but its diet is more similar to the diets of the other nations of North Africa than of 
Syria or Lebanon.
Algeria.  Cereal grains provide much of the protein in Algeria, but goat, lamb, 
and chicken sources of protein generally are preferred rather than fish. Goat 
cheese and yogurt are widely consumed. Tomatoes, originally obtained 
from Spain, are popular, as are peppers and onions. Couscous made from 
semolina wheat is commonly served with a meat, vegetables, gravy, and 
flavorings. Couscous also is served with sweets. Fruits widely consumed 
include dates, apricots, and grapes. Strong coffee and tea are popular.
Egypt. Traditionally, Egypt has relied on fish and other seafood as a major 
part of the diet, although meats, including camel, also have been part of 
their cuisine. Pork is not eaten by Muslims. Falafel, made from fava beans 
rather than chickpeas, is popular in Egypt. Wheat and other cereals are 
staples; wheat is derived from the Near East. Flat breads (no yeast) are com -
monly consumed, and they are often baked in home ovens. The less affluent 
regularly consume more grains, including rice, and vegetables, but fewer 
animal products. Legumes, including fava beans, are staples, and they are 
often mashed and mixed with onions and fried in olive or other oils. Other 
vegetables are eaten less frequently.
Libya. Libyan food patterns are similar to those of their neighboring coun -
tries. Couscous, a popular grain source, is prepared with peppers, chick -
peas, and other vegetables in pots with spices, typically heated, as a daily 
dish. Meat consumption is minimal because of cost, except at special occa -
sions. Milk and milk products, such as buttermilk, are regularly consumed, 
as are dates and seasonal fruits. Pasta may be consumed as a substitute for 
couscous. Green tea is a primary beverage.
Morocco. Moroccan cuisine  also includes couscous as the primary grain, 
and it typically is served with various tomato sauces and cheeses. Other 
food items, such as raisins, oranges, and spices, commonly are added to the 
sauces. Meats such as mutton, veal, or beef may be added to the couscous 
dish, which also typically contains vegetables and spices. The traditional 
thick and creamy soup, known as harira or hareera, may be made with a 24 The Mediterranean Way of Eating

variety of ingredients, including meat, vegetables, nuts, and spices. Figs and 
dates commonly are eaten, as are seasonal fruits. Bread and olive oil also 
are eaten, along with coffee or tea, particularly at breakfast.
Tunisia. Tunisians consume diets similar to Libyans. Coastal people eat more 
fish and other seafood than those who live inland, who prefer some form 
of meat, sheep (mutton) or goats. Couscous is popular and is used often in 
stews with meat and vegetables. Eggs are well liked and so are other vegeta -
bles, especially chili peppers and tomatoes. Fruits commonly eaten include 
figs, dates, and citrus. Olives and olive oil are consumed daily. Common 
beverages are coffee in urban areas and tea in rural locales.
RECENT INFLUENCES OF PROCESSED FOODS AND FAST FOODS
The Mediterranean nations, like other nations of the world, increasingly are faced 
with the availability of highly processed foods and “fast” foods. Americans know 
all too well how easy it can be to replace healthful food—often more expensive and 
more labor intensive to prepare—with the convenience and relatively low cost of the 
less- healthful options.
This trade-  off has resulted in the increased risk of cardiovascular and other 
chronic diseases among the Mediterranean people, who traditionally were protected 
from chronic diseases by their dietary patterns. Ironically, even among these popula -
tions, a call has arisen to return to the “Mediterranean diet” of their ancestors. That 
requires, in addition to a more healthful array of food choices, a return to traditional 
Mediterranean patterns  of eating that led to better cardiovascular health.

GENERAL THREATS TO THE TRADITIONAL 
MEDITERRANEAN LIFESTYLE
The modern world has had enormous influences on the Mediterranean lifestyle. Several 
factors that have been especially powerful inducers of change include the following:
• Faster pace of life, which contributes to higher stress levels;
• Decrease in physical activities and increase in sedentary activities, such as 
watching television and using computers;
• Increase in numbers of women working outside the home who have less 
time for food purchasing and meal preparation;
• Onset of fast foods, relatively cheap and preprepared as meals;
• Increase in amount of highly refined and processed food products, espe -
cially breads, rolls, and other baked goods;26 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
• Change in local agricultural practices and decline in traditional foods of 
the region;
• Introduction and use of chemical fertilizers and other chemicals for pest 
control; and
• Increase in amount of waste products dumped into the Mediterranean 
Sea, resulting in serious pollution and declines in annual yields of fish and 
other seafood.
ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS OF EXTENSIVE FOOD PROCESSING
The addition of chemical additives  for the purpose of food preservation (extended 
shelf life), appearance, or other functions has increased the number of potentially 
adverse health effects. Although additives are typically low in quantity, a few may 
contribute to development of other diseases or to worsening of a disease already pres -
ent. Two additives, salt and table sugar, often are used in relatively large quantities 
for food preservation as well as taste. Other potential deleterious additives include 
monosodium glutamate (MSG), nitrates and nitrites, and high-  fructose corn syrup 
(HFCS). HFCS and several other chemical additives often are found in unhealthful, 
high-  calorie foods, including sweetened beverages. Global food companies continue 
to use these additives, or have used them in the recent past, to permit wide distribu -
tion of processed food items that have long shelf lives.
Highlight: Two additives, salt and table sugar, often are used in large quanti -
ties for food preservation as well as taste. Other potential deleterious additives 
include monosodium glutamate (MSG), nitrates and nitrites, and high-  fructose 
corn syrup (HFCS).
Nutrient additives  to foods, especially vitamins and minerals, generally are safe 
and potentially beneficial. Concerns exist, however, that some of these additives 
might be consumed in excessive amounts, even possibly at toxic levels, because of 
eating food rich in one specific nutrient and consuming supplements rich in the same 
nutrient. For example, calcium supplements also may be consumed along with food 
sources that naturally contain the nutrient or that have been fortified with calcium. 
Calcium is an essential nutrient, but excessive intakes of it may contribute to calci -
fication of arteries, such as the coronaries and heart valves, which increases the risk 
of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Consumers may not be aware of the potential 
risk for CVD and other diseases because of arterial calcification later in life. Adverse 
health effects of excessive consumption of other nutrients, including iron, phosphate, 
and vitamin A, also have been reported.
Highlight: Calcium is an essential nutrient, but excessive intakes of it may con -
tribute to calcification of arteries, such as the coronaries and heart valves, which 
increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).27 Dietary Patterns of the Mediterranean Nations
ADVERSE EFFECTS OF FAST FOODS
The term fast foods  generally refers to relatively inexpensive food that is prepared 
and served quickly and often eaten quickly. Typically, fast-  food meals also are lim -
ited in variety. Eating fast foods only occasionally is okay, but portion sizes should 
not be large. Including healthier choices at fast-  food restaurants may reduce weight 
gain and the risk of several chronic diseases.
Fast foods have permeated urban parts of the world. Fast-  food restaurants also 
can be found in Mediterranean countries, mainly in more populous cities, but 
also smaller communities, including coastal ports. Although fast foods are not 
always so “bad,” they often are prepared with high amounts of fat, especially satu -
rated fats and trans fats; highly refined carbohydrate; and salt. Healthy offerings 
recently introduced, such as green salads, grilled items, low-  fat yogurt, oatmeal, 
and fruit desserts with nuts, provide sufficient amounts of micronutrients and phyto -
chemicals. The major objections to fast foods continue to be the oversize servings, 
deep-  fried foods, sugar-  laden drinks, and limited quantities of fresh fruits and veg -
etables. Fish and other seafood choices prepared in a healthful way also are limited. 
Therefore, eating in a fast-  food restaurant almost always eliminates the possibility of 
eating “Mediterranean style.”
Highlight: Although fast foods are not always so “bad,” they often are prepared 
with high amounts of fat, especially saturated fats and trans fats; highly refined 
carbohydrate; and salt.
SUMMARY
Although dietary patterns vary somewhat country to country, each Mediterranean 
nation has learned over the centuries that a variety of foods from different food 
groups supports good health by providing all the essential nutrients needed by the 
body. The traditional diets of all four regions of the Mediterranean basin, it should 
be emphasized, consist mainly of nutrient-  rich plant foods, which also are the only 
sources of beneficial phytochemicals. Grains, especially whole grains and breads 
and other products, are important energy sources in all regions. The protein sources 
differ by region, with fish traditionally more important for coastal people and meats 
less so. Vegetables, especially dark greens, tomatoes, legumes, and fruits, are regu -
larly consumed in all regions, as are olives and olive oil, nuts and seeds, spices and 
herbs, and red wine (for those who drink alcohol). Olive oil not only substitutes for 
other animal fats or margarine, but also is a common component of practically all 
Mediterranean diets.
Today’s Mediterranean diets are no longer the traditional diets of the past. Since 
1970 or so, modern food processing and fast foods introduced from the United States 
and other Western nations have taken a greater hold on the traditional ways of prepar -
ing foods in most of these countries. The trend is toward highly processed foods con -
taining greater amounts of unhealthy nutrients, including many chemical additives.28 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
The health benefits of the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle, including a plant- 
based diet and slower-  paced dining, are being diminished, in part, because of 
increased intakes of total energy, lower-  energy expenditure, unhealthy fats, sugar 
and salt, and too few servings of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. 
Unfortunately, these changes in traditional Mediterranean lifestyle patterns have led 
to increasing rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and CVDs, which in turn have con -
tributed to rising rates of morbidity and mortality from these and other diet-  related 
chronic diseases and to reduced longevity. Young people are increasingly at risk for 
these largely preventable debilitating chronic diseases.29
3Critical Nutrients in Foods 
of Mediterranean Nations
Note:  The processing of information on the science of nutrients in this chapter 
requires slower reading. Some may want to skip this chapter now and refer to 
it as they proceed to further chapters.
INTRODUCTION
Mediterranean people who consume the diverse nutrients in the traditional diet 
of their country live longer lives and have reduced rates of the common chronic 
diseases. These observations are true despite the widespread poverty in which 
many have lived for generations. Plant foods and seafood—the traditional dietary 
pattern—supply all the essential nutrients as well as nonessential phytochemicals 
that provide healthful benefits.
Highlight: Plant foods and seafood—the traditional dietary pattern—supply 
all the essential nutrients as well as nonessential phytochemicals that provide 
healthful benefits.
Historically, the typical foods consumed in these nations were produced locally 
and prepared according to traditional family recipes. These foods contained no addi -
tives or other chemicals. Few animal foods were consumed, and they did not contain 
antibiotics. Fast foods and highly processed modern foods were not available, so that 
salt, sugar, and unhealthful fat consumption were minimal in previous generations. 
Changes in the diets of the Mediterranean nations beginning in the last half of the 
twentieth century are provided to highlight how the processing of foods, and hence 
nutrient composition, may lead to health compromises or disadvantages.
Some detail is given to the organic (carbon-  based molecules) structures of a few 
select nutrients to illustrate how nature has designed such a variety of molecules 
for body functions. Practical information related to most topics here are found in 
Chapters 8 through 16. These chapters highlight the nutrients and phytochemicals 
in specific foods and food groups and how they may help to prevent chronic diseases 
such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers.30 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
NUTRIENT AND PHYTOCHEMICAL 
COMPONENTS OF HEALTHY DIETS
All diets contain various proportions of the three macronutrients—carbohydrates, 
fats, and protein—but individual foods may be low or lacking in one or more of these 
components. Food selections in healthy diets, such as Mediterranean dietary patterns, 
provide a good balance of these macronutrients. In addition, these Mediterranean 
diets emphasize certain kinds of the three macronutrients from specific foods that 
have healthful benefits, such as whole grains over processed grains, unsaturated fats 
over saturated fats, and plant proteins over most animal proteins. Healthy diets also 
contain a variety of foods within each food group, and these supply the essential 
vitamins and minerals, as well as phytochemicals, and dietary fiber.
ENERGY FROM MACRONUTRIE NTS
As an important component for supporting health, energy intakes from macronutri -
ents in the past tended to be much less than in today’s world. Therefore, marginal 
undernutrition from consuming too few macronutrients, but not severe deficiency, 
was more common in the past than currently, when obesity has become a major prob -
lem in much of the world. Because traditional Mediterranean diets were so balanced 
in food macronutrients, conditions of either extreme undernutrition or overnutrition 
were previously rare in these nations.
Energy intakes by Mediterranean populations are currently lower than in most 
Western populations, and they result in lower rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes mel -
litus, and other major chronic diseases. The lower rates result not only from less total 
energy consumed but also partly from the higher fiber content of Mediterranean 
diets (see the following material and Chapters 9 through 11) and the rich supply of 
phytochemicals in plant foods. Also, the greater daily physical activity undertaken 
by Mediterranean populations contributes to their health.
Highlight: Energy intakes by Mediterranean populations are currently lower 
than in most Western populations, and they result in lower rates of obesity, type 2 
diabetes mellitus, and other major chronic diseases.
Much of the energy in food macronutrients is converted by cells to adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP), which is produced from the carbon–  hydrogen bonds of mostly 
carbohydrates and fats plus lesser amounts from proteins and alcohol. The cellular 
ATP is used to make many different kinds of molecules, some to be used only in 
the cells that produce them and others to be transferred to blood to be used by cells 
elsewhere in the body.
Only two macronutrients, carbohydrates and fats, provide the bulk of the energy, 
as calories, in our diets. About 80–85% of our energy is derived from the carbon– 
hydrogen (C–  H) chemical bonds of these two types of macronutrients. Protein 
provides about 15–20% of food energy. Protein molecules also are used in other 31 Critical Nutrients in Foods of Mediterranean Nations
ways, such as structural components and to meet the needs of other critical cel -
lular and extracellular functions. Table 3.1 lists the ranges of macronutrient contri -
butions to the total caloric intake of the typical Mediterranean diet and the typical 
Western diet.
Highlight: Only two macronutrients, carbohydrates and fats, provide the bulk of 
the energy, as calories, in our diets.
types of MAcronutrients
Each type of macronutrient is briefly described in this section, often with typical 
chemical structures, but readers need to be concerned less about the specific struc -
tures than about the general differences.
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are hydrocarbon molecules; that is, they contain hydrogen (H) and 
oxygen (O) atoms linked to carbon (C) atoms in a rather uniform way. When chemi -
cally degraded for energy, the C–  H bonds of all carbohydrates generate not only 
energy but also, as waste products, carbon dioxide and water. Glucose is the “model” 
unit used in making both sugars or short-  chain carbohydrates and starches or long- 
chain carbohydrates. The C–  H bonds of carbohydrates generate approximately 
4 kilocalories (kcal) per gram, but the total amount of energy as ATP gained from 
dietary carbohydrates represents more than 50% of the total food-  derived energy.TABLE  3.1

values listed because of large variations.32 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
• Starches. Starches are long-  chain carbohydrates included in good amounts 
in most of the cereal grains, such as wheat, corn, and rice. These hydrocar -
bon molecules may be linear (i.e., unbranched) or branched. Branches off 
the main linear polysaccharide (long molecules composed of many glucose 
units linked in a row) chain permits more efficient storage. The basic unit in 
all the starches is glucose, a six-  carbon molecule. Table 3.2 states the struc -
tural differences of unbranched and branched starches along with sugars.
• Sugars. Sugars are found mainly in fruits, but they also are rich in sugar -
cane and sugar beets. Common sugars include glucose, fructose, and 
sucrose. Other sugars also exist naturally in foods. Most sugar substitutes 
are not natural sugars or starches, but they do contain very low-  calorie mol -
ecules that provide sweetness.
• Glycerol. Glycerol, sometimes called glycerin, is a three-  carbon carbo -
hydrate used to make fats, such as triglycerides and phospholipids. When 
metabolized, glycerol generates energy, but the amount is relatively small 
compared to fat- and sugar-  derived energy.
Fats
The fats, primarily the fatty acids, are degraded for the purpose of converting energy 
in the C–  H bonds of the hydrocarbon molecules to usable cellular energy (i.e., ATP). A 
gram of pure fat—from all three types of fatty acids—generates approximately 9 kcal 
of energy. Table 3.3 illustrates the Atwater energy equivalents of the macronutrients.TABLE  3.2

The three types of naturally occurring fatty acids are saturated, monounsaturated, 
and polyunsaturated. Polyunsaturated fatty acids exist as either omega-6 or omega-3 
forms, with the omega carbon the last one in the hydrocarbon chain of the fatty acid.
Practically all trans fats (or trans-  fatty acids) are industrially created by add -
ing hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid. These partially 
hydrogenated oils contain one double bond, but they are metabolized similarly to 
saturated fatty acids or simply fats. Energy contained in the bonds of trans fats is 
rapidly generated following degradation, or it is used for the synthesis of storage 
fats in the body.
Proteins
Proteins contain many amino acids linked end to end like boxcars of a train 
(Table 3.4). The C–  H bonds of proteins, or their amino acids, are converted to energy 
also (i.e., 4 kcal per gram), but the total amount of energy as ATP gained from pro -
teins represents roughly 15–20% of the total food-  derived energy.
Alcohol
Although not a true macronutrient,  alcohol, really ethanol molecules, also may be 
converted into cellular energy or ATP, but the amount of energy depends on the 
amount of alcohol consumed. All types of alcoholic beverages provide energy from 
the alcohol, but some of these beverages include sugars that contribute to the total 
amount of energy per drink. In general, most American adult males who drink con -
sume about 3% of their total energy from alcoholic beverages and adult females 
approximately 1–2%. Each gram of alcohol generates 7 kcal of energy when metabo -
lized to carbon dioxide and water.
protein  Also serves As A source  of AMino Acids
Amino acids are the building blocks of the linear array of proteins. A mixture of 
approximately 20 different amino acids in foods is needed to synthesize the great 
variety of proteins needed in our bodies. About half of these amino acids are essen -
tial; that is, they cannot be made by humans, and they must be supplied by diet almost 
every day in amounts that support growth, tissue repair, or maintenance of tissues. TABLE  3.4

The other half of these amino acids are not essential because they can normally be 
made from other small molecules or other amino acids in our cells.
Most plant proteins are deficient or low in one or more specific amino acids, whereas 
animal proteins tend to be more complete in amino acid composition. Mediterranean 
people typically consume less animal protein than North Americans. Consuming two 
or more different sources of plant proteins, such as grains and legumes in the same 
meal or from meals during the same day, provides the complete array of amino acids, 
especially the essential ones, needed for protein synthesis.
Essential Amino Acids
About 10 essential amino acids must be consumed in the diet on a regular basis. 
These “building” molecules are critical for the synthesis of new proteins, a process 
requiring specific amino acids as part of the template for the entire protein molecule. 
This process goes on every day, but rates of synthesis vary according to needs dur -
ing life, such as growth, pregnancy, milk production, tissue maintenance, or tissue 
repair. If not used for the synthesis of a broad range of proteins or other complex 
molecules, the essential amino acids, like the nonessential ones, are degraded for 
cellular energy. Mediterranean populations typically obtain sufficient amounts of 
both essential and nonessential amino acids from their omnivorous diets containing 
both animal and plant protein sources. The hydrocarbon side groups of the essential 
amino acids make them indispensable in the diet because humankind cannot synthe -
size these side groups.
Nonessential Amino Acids
About 10 nonessential amino acids remain important for protein synthesis. These 
amino acids are dispensable because they can be made by our cells from other small 
molecules without being required in the diet. These 10 or so nonessential amino 
acids aid cells in their synthesis, especially in the rapidity of making new proteins, 
such as enzymes.
fAt As A source  of sAturAted And unsAturAted fAtty Acids
Fat, sometimes called neutral fat, is a general name for triglycerides, which provide 
energy and basic components of cell membranes. Triglycerides contain three fatty 
acids linked to one glycerol molecule. (Glycerol, you may recall, is actually a car -
bohydrate in its chemical composition.) The three fatty acids may represent any of 
the three types of hydrocarbon chains: saturated fatty acid (SFA), monounsaturated 
fatty acid (MFA or MUFA), or polyunsaturated fatty acid (PFA or PUFA). The qual -
ity of the fat from different types of foods depends on the relative proportions of 
these three types of fatty acid molecules. Plant fats or oils tend to be richer in the 
mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids than animal fats. Specific polyunsaturated 
fatty acids must be obtained from plant sources or fish or fish oils to meet the needs 
of various tissues for structures, such as cell membranes, that incorporate these two 
types of fatty acids.35 Critical Nutrients in Foods of Mediterranean Nations
Saturated Fatty Acids
All carbon atoms are fully saturated with hydrogen atoms; therefore, SFA molecules 
contain no double bonds, which enable them to be metabolized (i.e., easily degraded 
to carbon dioxide and water). Examples of food that are rich in SFAs are whole 
(full-  fat) milk and dairy products, other animal foods, and palm and tropical oils. 
Figure 3.1 illustrates SFAs and the other two types of fatty acids.
Monounsaturated Fatty Acids
Oleic acid, the most common of the MFAs, is found in high amounts in olives, olive 
oil, and canola oil. Olives are used in numerous dishes, both cooked and uncooked, 
in Mediterranean diets. Olive oil is used typically in salad dressings, marinades, and 
for bread dipping. MFA molecules contain only one double bond between adjacent 
carbon atoms (Figure 3.1). The term double bond  refers to the carbon–  carbon (C=C) 
bonds within the hydrocarbon chain of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids. One major difference between Mediterranean and Western dietary patterns is 
the large amount of oleic acid that is consumed from olive-  oil- rich Mediterranean 
meals. The total percentage of calories from oleic acid ranges around 20% to 25% 
of the total caloric intake, a figure suggesting that most of the fat intake in these 
countries derives from olive oil. This striking pattern of olive oil consumption is 
highlighted in Chapter 8.
Highlight: One major difference between Mediterranean and Western dietary 
patterns is the large amount of oleic acid that is consumed from olive-  oil- rich 
Mediterranean meals.
Trans-  fatty acids  are mostly MFAs, but the three-  dimensional position of the 
one double bond is trans  rather than cis. Trans forms of fatty acids are degraded 
more rapidly than cis forms; therefore, trans-  fatty acids are metabolized similarly 
to SFAs. In the recent past, fairly large amounts of trans fats containing trans fatty 
acids have been used in butter-  like fat spreads (margarines) and other foods, but 
many of these have been eliminated recently or greatly reduced. Naturally occurring 
trans fats in meats, dairy products, and other animal foods typically provide only 
small contributions to consumers of these foods.Saturate dM onouns aturated Polyunsa turate d

and polyunsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 FAs differ according to the placement of the first 
double bond.36 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids
PFAs exist in foods in two major forms, but cell metabolic pathways also can syn -
thesize these, although typically not in sufficient amounts to meet functional needs. 
The two major forms are omega-6 PFAs and omega-3 PFAs. (Also, the scientific 
nomenclature uses n-6 and n-3 rather than omega-6 and omega-3 in identifying these 
PFAs.) Although plant sources provide both forms, they typically contain much less 
of the omega-3 PFAs than do fish and fish oils. Meats and dairy foods contain little of 
the omega-3 PFAs. The PFA molecules contain two or more double bonds; if the last 
double bond is between the end (omega) carbon-3 and carbon-6 of the fatty acid, it is 
referred to as omega-3. Structures in Figure 3.1 illustrate the location of the double 
carbon bonds distant from the omega (last) carbon atom. Omega-6 fatty acids have 
the terminal double bond at the carbon-6 position in the molecule.
Two specific fatty acids, one in each series of PFAs, are essential linoleic acid and 
alpha-  linolenic acid (ALA).
• Omega-6 Fatty Acids. A typical omega-6 fatty acid is linoleic acid, which 
contains two double carbon–  carbon bonds in its structure. Linoleic acid 
may be elongated to form arachidonic acid (AA), also an omega-6 acid but 
longer than linoleic acid. Linoleic acid is considered an essential fatty acid, 
like the omega-3 fatty acid, ALA.
• Omega-3 Fatty Acids. ALA is the predominant vegetable source of an 
omega-3 PFA. Longer-  chain PFAs exist in fish, especially the fatty fish 
that usually live in the deepest and coldest water of the Mediterranean 
Sea. The longer-  chain PFAs, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), also may be obtained by metabolic conver -
sion of ALA under appropriate conditions, as occurs in strict vegetarians. 
Omnivores also convert ALA to the longer-  chain PFAs, but dietary intake 
is a more plentiful source of them than the biosynthetic pathway. Table 3.5  
lists the more common food sources of omega-3 fatty acids, namely, fatty 
fish and a few other foods (also see Chapter 12). Table 3.6 gives the typical 
percentages of the three main types of fats (i.e., SFAs, MFAs, and PFAs) in 
Mediterranean and Western diets.

MetAbolic conversions  of pfAs And the rAtio 
of oMegA-6s to oMegA-3s in diet
The cellular elongations of linoleic acid to AA and of ALA to EPA and DHA require 
specific enzymes, and these conversions are limited. These two distinct metabolic 
chains are critical for generating the final molecules, eicosanoids or prostaglandins, 
which operate in tissue and organ functions, such as birthing, heart contractions, and 
breathing (Table 3.7).
The omega-3 fatty acids have taken on much greater interest by researchers 
recently, and the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is now considered an impor -
tant marker of a healthy intake of these fatty acids. The dietary ratio of omega-6

the diet for health.TABLE  3.6

fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids is considered to be healthy when it is 10:1 or lower. 
Although research findings are not yet definitive, a ratio as low as 4:1 may be opti -
mal. Such a low ratio is difficult to obtain from foods. To approach such a low ratio, 
individuals need to consume fish or seafood, especially fatty fish like salmon and 
tuna, two or more times a week. Plant sources of omega-3 fatty acids eaten a few 
times per week provide additional amounts. Mediterranean people typically con -
sume diets fairly high in omega-3 fatty acids, including certain fish and substantial 
amounts of a wide variety of vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, 
which help keep the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 low. Table 3.8 illustrates the two 
types of PFAs, omega-6 and omega-3, generated from their precursor essential fatty 
acids typically consumed in foods. Soybeans and some other soy foods are fairly rich 
in omega-3 fatty acids, but they are not typically consumed in Mediterranean diets. 
These two types of PFAs are used in the synthesis of eicosanoids that are used in 
many body functions, but no conversions occur between the two different series of 
eicosanoids because of the lack of the needed enzyme.
Highlight: The dietary ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids is 
considered to be healthy when it is 10:1 or lower.
oxidAtive stress of dietAry fAts
The metabolism of dietary fats, mainly PFAs, contributes to the generation of greater 
amounts of oxidative degradation products known as peroxides. Meats and dairy 
products in the diet provide most of the SFAs and pro-  oxidant components, whereas 
cereals, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and fish contain lower amounts of SFAs. Since the 
last foods consumed in the Mediterranean diet contain more antioxidants, this diet 
also has a greater overall antioxidant capacity than typical Western diets. The health -
ier Mediterranean diet helps to protect against cardiovascular disease, cancer, and 
other diseases that may develop because of greater oxidative stress (see Chapters 4 
through 6).TABLE  3.8

cholesterol : A n onessenti Al nutrient  
but A critic Al Molecule  in lipoproteins
Cholesterol is obtained from all animal foods, but not from plant foods. Rather than 
cholesterol, plants make other sterols that help lower the total burden of cholesterol. 
Serum cholesterol concentrations, both total cholesterol (from all the lipoproteins) 
and the low-  density lipoprotein (LDL)–cholesterol fraction, increase the risk of car -
diovascular disease, especially coronary heart disease (CHD), because of their contri -
bution to arterial fat deposits that develop into large plaques. As described in further 
chapters, dietary cholesterol intake itself is a smaller risk factor for CHD than are 
saturated fats and trans fats. Both cholesterol and saturated fat are provided by ani -
mal meats and dairy products; thus, the two risk factors are often bundled together. 
Plant foods have no cholesterol, and with only a few exceptions, they contain low 
amounts of saturated fats. So, a nutritionally optimal diet should be low in saturated 
fats, trans fats, and cholesterol and include a good mix of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty 
acids and some MFAs from olive oil. A plant-  rich diet automatically provides good 
amounts of dietary fiber. See Chapters 9 and especially 10  for additional details.
Lipoproteins enable the fat-  soluble molecules to be carried about the body in 
blood because of their protein and phospholipid content. Lipoproteins are simply 
loose aggregates that contain some fat (as triglycerides) and cholesterol, along with 
phospholipids that circulate to tissues, such as muscle and adipose, to supply the fat- 
soluble molecules. Very low-  density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are produced by the liver 
for distribution to the rest of the body via blood. Much of the cholesterol remains in 
circulating LDL particles, which eventually are removed from blood by the liver. 
In addition, high-  density lipoprotein (HDL) particles transport cholesterol in reverse 
from tissues to the liver for much more rapid disposal. The combination of a higher 
serum HDL level and a lower serum LDL level is, therefore, beneficial to arterial 
health and helps delay or even reduce plaque development.
The cholesterol that circulates in strict vegetarians or vegans is not from food, 
but from their own liver production. Vegans generally have no problem with high 
serum cholesterol, except for abnormal genetic factors. Omnivores get much of their 
cholesterol from diet and also produce a good amount in the liver, to some degree 
dependent on how much is provided by the diet. Lipoproteins operate similarly in 
vegans and omnivores, but omnivores typically have higher serum LDL and total 
cholesterol concentrations because of dietary intakes from animal products.
MICRONUTRIENTS
Micronutrients include all vitamins and minerals.
WAter- soluble  vitAMins
Water-  soluble vitamins include several B vitamins and vitamin C, or ascorbic acid. 
Many structurally diverse B vitamins have different functional roles in metabolism. 
All are needed in minimal amounts, but optimal intakes of these micro  nutrients 
are considered to promote health and prevent disease. These water-  soluble vitamins 40 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
typically act as enzyme cofactors that enhance metabolic reactions. Excessive 
amounts of these vitamins (i.e., greater than recommended dietary allowance 
[RDA] amounts) are not advised unless specifically prescribed by a physician. 
Mediterranean populations typically consume adequate amounts of all the water- 
soluble vitamins because their diets contain both plant and animal foods. Strict 
vegetarians (vegans) are deficient in dietary sources of vitamin B12, known also as 
cobalamin. Supplements of this vitamin are strongly recommended for vegans who 
do not consume any animal foods. Table 3.9 gives examples of water-  soluble vita -
mins as well as fat-  soluble vitamins.
Highlight: Mediterranean populations typically consume adequate amounts of 
all the water-  soluble vitamins because their diets contain both plant and ani -
mal foods.
Folic acid, or folate, is an important B vitamin commonly found to be low in 
modern diets because of insufficient intake of dark-  green, leafy vegetables. Recent 
fortification of folic acid in wheat flours has increased intake of this critical vitamin 
in the United States and Canada, and rates of women having babies with neuro -
tubular defects have declined greatly because of improved folate intakes prior to and 
during pregnancy.
fAt- soluble  vitAMins
The four fat-  soluble vitamins are vitamins A, D, E, and K, but all of these have dif -
ferent sources and, as such, may be designated with different names, subscripts, or 
even numbers . For example, much of our vitamin A intake actually is obtained from 
plant molecules known as carotenes (carotenoids), which require metabolic degrada -
tion before conversion to vitamin A. Different dietary sources of vitamin D exist, 
but skin biosynthesis of this molecule may provide most of our vitamin D from ultra -
violet B (UVB) in sunlight, except during the late autumn, winter, and early spring. 
The circulating form of vitamin D (whether from diet or skin) serves as a storage TABLE  3.9

metabolite that can be converted to the hormonal form. Several different forms of 
vitamin E (tocopherol) occur in nature. Vitamin K from plant sources is known 
as phylloquinone, or vitamin K1, but other forms of vitamin K also exist. The fat- 
soluble vitamins have a variety of functions in tissues. Mediterranean populations 
typically consume sufficient amounts of all fat-  soluble vitamins (Table 3.9).
MAcroMiner Als
Macrominerals, or bulk minerals, should be consumed in fairly sizable amounts each 
day. These include calcium, phosphorus (as phosphates), magnesium, potassium, 
sodium, and chloride (anionic form of chlorine). Sulfur (S) is also placed in this cat -
egory, but practically all sulfur is part of S-  containing amino acids and a few other 
organic molecules. Of the bulk elements, calcium, magnesium, and potassium are 
commonly low or even deficient in the diets of many in the United States, whereas 
sodium and phosphate intakes typically are too high. Mediterranean people gener -
ally obtain adequate dietary amounts of macrominerals, with the possible exception 
of calcium. Calcium is illustrated as a common divalent cation (positively charged 
ion) in Table 3.10. Phosphate, a common anion (negatively charged ion) found in 
foods, and an essential mineral, is typically consumed in amounts much higher than 
recommended because of phosphate salts used in food processing (Table 3.10). High 
phosphate intakes may have adverse effects on health and may be associated with 
increased morbidity and mortality. The ratio of these two minerals, Ca:P, is signifi -
cant. Too low a ratio (i.e., low calcium to high phosphate) leads to an increase in 
parathyroid hormone, which may increase bone mineral loss. Older adults, mainly 
women, may need calcium supplements when usual intakes are too low, but phos -
phate supplements virtually are never needed.
Sodium, potassium, and chloride, known as serum electrolytes, have major roles 
in cells and out of cells within body fluids. Western diets currently tend to be too 
high in sodium and too low in potassium because of too little consumption of plant 
foods and too much intake of sodium from processed foods.

Highlight: Western diets currently tend to be too high in sodium and too low in 
potassium because of too little consumption of plant foods and too much intake 
of sodium from processed foods.
Micro Miner Als
Microminerals or trace elements need to be consumed each day in small amounts, 
much less than for the macrominerals. Iron is the trace element typically short in the 
diets of women, especially menstruating women, and often of men throughout 
the world. In postmenopausal women, older men, and those genetically susceptible 
to iron overload (hemochromatosis), iron supplements typically are not needed. Iron, 
which exists largely as “heme iron” in red meats, is more highly available for intes -
tinal absorption compared to “ionic iron” or “non-heme iron” found in plant foods 
such as spinach. Partial vegetarians and vegans are most likely to have deficient 
intakes of iron because they consume so little heme iron. Low iron intakes are asso -
ciated with low serum hemoglobin and, in extreme cases, anemia. Ionic iron is found 
in foods as both divalent and trivalent cations, as illustrated in Table 3.10.
Other trace elements, such as zinc, also may be low in the diets of many adults. 
Mediterranean populations typically consume adequate intakes of the trace ele -
ments, except possibly for heme iron, because they eat food from many plant sources 
on a regular basis. Iodine, for example, is generally plentiful because of the con -
sumption of fish and other seafood.
WATER
Water, “the forgotten” nutrient, is consumed sufficiently by most Mediterranean 
peoples, but those who live in desert regions may have shortages of freshwater. 
Vegetables and fruits generally are high in water content, and soups, stews, and 
mixed dishes also provide good amounts of water in Mediterranean diets. Wine, cof -
fee, and tea also contribute useful fluids to help maintain water balance. The popular 
prescription of eight glasses a day is not supported by science, but sufficient amounts 
of water—a nonspecific amount—are needed each day for adequate hydration.
DIETARY FIBER
Because dietary fiber is located in plant wall structures, it can be acquired only 
through eating plant foods (not animal foods). Two types of fiber exist: water solu -
ble, primarily from fruits and vegetables, and water insoluble, mainly from whole 
grains. While not a nutrient per se, fiber plays important roles in several human 
functions. Chemically, certain fibers are classified as nondigestible carbohydrates 
because they cannot be broken down by our enzymes in the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract to constituent components (i.e., they cannot be digested). Fiber consumption in 
traditional Mediterranean diets was plentiful because of the intake of whole grains, 
fruits, legumes, and other vegetables each day (see also Chapters 9 and 10). Food 43 Critical Nutrients in Foods of Mediterranean Nations
digestion in the stomach and upper GI tract is slowed by the presence of substantial 
amounts of fiber, which in turn slows absorption of macronutrients from within the 
small intestine following the onset of eating. Fiber, however, speeds up the rate of 
transit of undigested food components in the large intestine.
Highlight: Because dietary fiber is located in plant wall structures, it can be 
acquired only through eating of plant foods (not animal foods).
After a fiber-  rich meal, the body’s digestion of starches and disaccharide sugars in 
the upper GI tract slows the time it takes for glucose to enter the bloodstream. Blood 
glucose increases less in the first hour after eating fiber-  rich foods, and then it dips 
below an individual’s typical fasting glucose level by around the third hour postmeal. 
The lower insulin secretion that results from the slower glucose entry from a high- 
fiber meal into blood improves the effectiveness of insulin (i.e., insulin sensitivity) 
and may help reduce the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes (see Chapter 4).
The dietary fiber content of the two types of fiber in common foods is listed in 
Appendix A.
PHYTOCHEMICALS: NONNUTRIENT MOLECULES 
THAT BENEFIT HEALTH
Many types of plant molecules, not nutrients per se, are consumed as part of the 
diverse foods in plant-  rich diets of Mediterranean people. Because so many of these 
naturally occurring phytomolecules act as antioxidants, the phytochemical-  rich 
diets of peoples living around the Mediterranean Sea should help support health 
and reduce the risks of common chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart 
disease, and cancer (see Chapters 4 through 6). Examples of a few structures of phy -
tochemicals, also known as phytomolecules, are given in Table 3.11.

derived from plant sources. Some plant foods have high quantities of antioxidants, 
whereas others have lower amounts. Animal foods contain virtually no antioxidant 
phytochemicals. (Animals feed on plant foods, so they may have only low amounts 
of antioxidant phytomolecules in their tissues at any time.)

antioxidants. Fruits, vegetables, and nuts contain the most antioxidants, whereas 
cereal grains are much lower in these phytomolecules. Vegetarians (vegans, lacto- 
vegetarians, and lacto-  ovo- vegetarians) typically have higher circulating concen -
trations of antioxidant vitamins and nonnutrient phytochemicals than omnivores 
because they consume greater quantities of plant foods. Virgin olive oil is quite rich 
in antioxidant capacity.
SUMMARY
The typical patterns of food selection in Mediterranean countries provide several 
nutrients in optimal quantities and practically all nonnutrient phytochemicals and 
dietary fiber in sufficient amounts to support health and protect against disease. The 
following nutrients are especially well supplied by Mediterranean diets: omega-3 
fatty acids; MFAs; potassium; magnesium; zinc; B vitamins; vitamin C; vitamins 
A, D, E, and K; and water. The nutrients reviewed here, summarized in Table 3.13, 
are especially rich in the Mediterranean dietary pattern. Some other dietary patterns 
also typically contain these nutrients, just not the whole range or in as great amounts.

4Obesity and Type 2 
Diabetes Mellitus
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, interest in the role a Mediterranean dietary pattern may play in 
reducing risk of two chronic diseases, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (referred 
to from now on as type 2 diabetes), has greatly increased. This heightened interest 
results, in part, because of the skyrocketing incidences of both obesity and type 2 
diabetes in the United States, as well as in many other countries. Data from the 2011 
National Diabetes Fact Sheet (http://www.cdc.gov/  diabetes/  pubs/  factsheet11.htm) 
show that diabetes, type 1 and type 2, affects 25.8 million people in the U.S. popu -
lation. In 2010, almost 1.9 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in adults 
aged 20 years or older. Of these cases, roughly 90% to 95% have type 2 diabetes. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also predicted that nearly 
one of three children born in the United States in 2000 will become diabetic in their 
lifetime. Equally alarming is the fact that approximately 79 million people in the 
United States have prediabetes, and many of these people are not even aware of their 
condition and the serious threats to health it poses.
Highlight: Approximately 79 million people in the United States have predia -
betes, and many of these people are not even aware of their condition and the 
serious threats to health it poses.
Significant overweight and obesity typically exist before the onset of type 2 dia -
betes, making weight management a crucial factor in helping to reduce the risks of 
this diet-  related disease. Being obese also increases the likelihood of contracting 
other serious chronic diseases. And, the longer one remains obese, the greater the 
risk of mortality. Currently, more than one-  third of U.S. adults (35.7%) are obese. In 
2013, the American Medical Association officially designated obesity as a disease to 
underscore the seriousness of this condition. It is hoped that declaring obesity as a 
disease will stimulate more research to discover better ways to help prevent, as well 
as treat, this condition, along with providing some reimbursement related to medical 
treatment. Medical expenditures associated with treating obesity and diabetes and 
their complications in the United States cost many billions of dollars every year, 
and they continue to rise. Clearly, obesity and type 2 diabetes have become a major 
global public health issue that needs greater emphasis on early prevention through 
dietary and other lifestyle behavior changes.48 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
This chapter highlights the biological conditions for developing obesity and 
type 2 diabetes. Chapters 7 through 16 follow up on the specific components of a 
Mediterranean dietary pattern that benefit overall health and reduce the risk of, and 
even possibly reverse, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic diseases. In addi -
tion, individuals who are already obese or diagnosed with diabetes will likely be 
able to improve their health and well-  being by following a Mediterranean-  style diet.
OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY
Excessive accumulation of body fat typically results from greater consumption of calo -
ries in relation to lower caloric expenditure in daily activities. The particular foods one 
eats also may contribute to weight gain and increased body fat. The accumulation of 
fat or triglycerides in fat cells (adipocytes) is derived primarily from dietary carbohy -
drates and fats. Fat cells use glucose and fatty acids to synthesize new triglycerides. 
As long as excessive amounts of these two building block molecules are available, fat 
cells can go on and on in their synthesis of storage fats. Individual fat cells increase in 
size until their storage capacity reaches the maximum, when new fat cells are recruited 
from bone marrow to begin accumulating fat. While healthy people have only 15% 
(males) to 25% (females) body fat, obese subjects may increase their fat stores to more 
than 50% of their body weight and reach weights of several hundred pounds.
Highlight: Excessive accumulation of body fat results from greater consumption 
of calories in relation to lower caloric expenditure in daily activities.
Overweight and obesity are calculated using the body mass index (BMI) as a 
proxy for measurement of body fat percentage. Two formulas based on height and 
weight can be used for calculating BMI: the metric system in kilograms and meters 
or the English system in pounds and inches (see Table 4.1). A BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 is 
TABLE  4.1
Calculation of Body Mass Index (BMI) for Adults
Measurement Units Formula and Calculation
Kilograms and meters 
(or centimeters)Formula: Weight (kg)/[Height (m)]2
With the metric system, the formula for BMI is weight in kilograms divided by 
height in meters squared. Since height is commonly measured in centimeters, 
divide height in centimeters by 100 to obtain height in meters.
Example: Weight = 68 kg, Height = 165 cm (1.65 m)
Calculation: 68 ÷ (1.65)2 = 24.98
Pounds and inches Formula: Weight (lb)/[Height (in.)]2 × 703
Calculate BMI by dividing weight in pounds (lb) by height in inches (in.) 
squared and multiplying by a conversion factor of 703.
Example: Weight = 150 lb, Height = 5 ʹ5″ (65″)
Calculation: [150 ÷ (65)2] × 703 = 24.9649 Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
classified as overweight, while a BMI of 30 or more is termed obese (see Table 4.2). 
Controversy exists over whether BMI is the best predictor for obesity-  linked diseases. 
While the BMI estimates total body fat, it does not indicate where the fat is located. 
Excess fat stored in the legs and buttocks (“pear-  shaped” bodies) generally is consid -
ered less harmful than visceral fat stored in the abdomen (“apple-  shaped” bodies). 
Ectopic fat refers to fat that accumulates in places where it does not belong, such as in 
the heart and liver. Importantly, as visceral fat builds up around the abdomen, ectopic 
fat also increases, leading to a heightened potential for serious medical problems, 
including heart disease, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. While the debate 
continues regarding the most harmful type of dietary fat consumed, any excess fat 
that goes into body storage depots generally increases the risk for having one or more 
serious medical conditions. Several alternatives to BMI have been proposed, but all 
measures have their unique shortcomings. BMI, together with waist circumference, 
remain reasonably good body fat measures for predicting disease so that preventive 
action can be initiated when needed. These measures are also less expensive, less 
time consuming, and easier to perform than most other alternative measures.
The prevalence of overweight and obesity has steadily increased over the past 
several decades among women, men, and children of all ages; all racial and ethnic 
groups; all educational levels; and all levels of smoking. Nearly two-  thirds of U.S. 
adults age 20 or over are either overweight or obese, including the great majority 
of people with type 2 diabetes. This situation causes much concern as the relation -
ship between weight, especially BMI, and type 2 diabetes points to excess weight 
as the single most important risk factor for this type of diabetes. The term diabesity  
expresses this close relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes, two chronic 
diseases that have enormous health consequences.

tes points to excess weight as the single most important risk factor for this type

DIABETES MELLITUS
Diabetes mellitus, or just diabetes, is a group of diseases characterized by high blood 
sugar (glucose) levels and other adverse changes, including those affecting arterial 
wall functions. In diabetes, dietary macronutrients (i.e., carbohydrates, fats, and pro -
teins) are not metabolized in the normal way. Typically, all consumed foods are 
digested within the gastrointestinal tract to their basic component molecules. The 
simple sugar, glucose, results from the breakdown of starches and disaccharide sug -
ars. In the small intestine, glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream to be used by the 
body’s cells for energy or, to a lesser extent, to be stored as glycogen for later use. For 
glucose to enter the body’s cells, the pancreatic hormone insulin must be secreted 
in sufficient amounts to lower the blood glucose concentration to its usual fasting or 
baseline level.
In individuals without diabetes, as insulin concentration rises in the bloodstream, 
it stimulates the uptake of glucose by insulin-  responsive cells throughout the body. 
Thus, the action of insulin causes a decline in blood glucose during the postmeal, or 
postprandial, period of approximately 3–4 hours toward the usual fasting level. In 
individuals with diabetes, however, there are problems with insulin secretion or its 
action on cells that move glucose into cells from the blood.
Highlight: For glucose to enter the body’s cells, the pancreatic hormone insulin 
must be secreted in sufficient amounts to lower the blood glucose concentration 
to its usual fasting or baseline level.
Type 1 diabetes , formerly called insulin-  dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or 
juvenile-  onset diabetes mellitus, results when the beta cells, also known as B cells, 
of the pancreas stop making insulin or make only a tiny amount. Type 1 diabetes 
usually occurs in young people, but adults of any age may also develop this type. It 
generally develops suddenly and may be triggered by genes, viruses, or an autoim -
mune disorder. Therefore, some type of exogenous insulin is needed to replace the 
insulin the body no longer is able to make. In this case, insulin is typically provided 
by injection or an insulin pump.
Type 2 diabetes , formerly called non-  insulin-  dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), 
or adult-  onset diabetes mellitus, results when insulin secretion at first may be ade -
quate, but it is not effective in stimulating peripheral body cells, especially muscle 
cells and fat cells, to take up glucose from the blood. This condition is known as 
insulin insensitivity or insulin resistance and causes the blood glucose concentration 
to rise and remain abnormally elevated during fasting. In this early stage, blood glu -
cose control often can be adequately managed by diet and exercise alone or in com -
bination with various diabetes medications. Later in the course of type 2 diabetes, 
pancreatic beta cells begin to wear out and can no longer secrete enough insulin to 
lower the elevated blood glucose concentration. At this later stage, exogenous insulin 
is needed, just as in individuals with type 1 diabetes, to help control blood glucose 
and reduce further damage to arterial vessels that supply the eyes and other organs 51 Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
of the body. With good blood glucose control early after detection, however, the pro -
gression to type 2 diabetes may be delayed or even inhibited. Figure 4.1 illustrates 
the change in blood glucose from normal to type 2 diabetes and the change in insulin 
secretion from normal to type 2 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes in the past rarely occurred in adults less than 40 years of age. 
That, however, is no longer the case. Today, the disturbing and dramatic increase 
in type 2 diabetes occurs in young adults as well as in children. Since the signs and 
symptoms of type 2 diabetes do not usually manifest themselves as suddenly as those 
of type 1 diabetes, diagnosis may be delayed from 7 to 10 years after onset of this 
silent disease. During this period of time, a condition called prediabetes  exists. This 
condition is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) 
or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). In prediabetes, blood glucose concentrations 
are elevated above normal but not yet high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes. 
Prediabetes is diagnosed when fasting blood glucose levels are between 100 and 
125 mg/ dL.
Highlight: Today, the disturbing and dramatic increase in type 2 diabetes occurs 
in young adults as well as in children.
Higher-  than-  normal concentrations of glucose circulating in the blood over time 
can early initiate damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Individuals with 
prediabetes are already at increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke and thus

would benefit from early detection and management of prediabetes. Making mod -
est changes in diet, such as following a Mediterranean-  style diet, and other lifestyle 
behaviors would help individuals with prediabetes to delay or even prevent some of 
these serious vascular complications, including the progression to type 2 diabetes.
RELATIONSHIPS AMONG OBESITY, INSULIN RESISTANCE, 
INFLAMMATION, AND TYPE 2 DIABETES
The increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes in the United States and many other 
countries is typically preceded by a rising incidence of obesity. Obesity is associ -
ated with insulin resistance , more so if excess fat is stored in the belly (visceral or 
android fat). Insulin resistance exists when body cells, primarily muscle and fat cells, 
become less sensitive to an elevated blood insulin concentration (hyperinsulinemia). 
This resistance decreases the ability of body cells to take in glucose. As the blood 
glucose concentration builds up over time, the beta cells of the pancreas respond 
by secreting more and more insulin. As body fat increases, insulin resistance also 
increases. When the blood glucose concentration remains elevated, the beta cells 
begin to lose their ability to produce enough insulin to maintain a normal blood glu -
cose concentration, leading to glucose intolerance and eventually to type 2 diabetes.
Highlight: When the blood glucose concentration remains elevated, the beta 
cells begin to lose their ability to produce enough insulin to maintain a normal 
blood glucose concentration, leading to glucose intolerance and eventually to 
type 2 diabetes.
Insulin resistance may be reversed or made less severe by losing some excess 
body weight, even possibly as little as 10 pounds. Numerous studies have shown 
that a large percentage of type 2 diabetes cases may be reversed by managing weight 
and adopting healthy lifestyle behaviors. Maintaining a nutritious eating pattern, 
such as a Mediterranean dietary pattern with modest portion sizes, engaging in 
regular physical activity, not smoking, and getting adequate sleep can help to man -
age weight and reduce insulin resistance.
Another factor associated with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance 
is inflammation  of body tissues. Inflammation results from local tissue injury that 
stimulates the body’s immune response, and it plays an important role in the healing 
process. For example, vascular injury may result from oxidized cholesterol in cir -
culating lipoproteins, a leading candidate thought to contribute to the inflammatory 
response. Once the injury is repaired, the inflammatory response usually subsides. 
However, under certain conditions, such as obesity, low levels of inflammation may 
persist indefinitely throughout the body. This state of chronic inflammation results 
in the frequent release of proteins made by adipose tissue called adipokines. Some of 
these proteins exhibit anti-  inflammatory effects, while other proteins cause low-  level 53 Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
inflammation throughout the body. Adiponectin, the most abundant adipokine, 
improves insulin sensitivity and exerts an anti-  inflammatory effect. Adiponectin, 
however, is found in significantly decreased concentrations in obese individuals, 
thereby reducing its beneficial effects.
Highlight: Under certain conditions, such as obesity, low levels of inflammation 
may persist indefinitely throughout the body.
EFFECTIVE DIETARY PATTERNS FOR LOSING WEIGHT 
AND REDUCING RISK OF TYPE 2 DIABETES
Type 2 diabetes typically leads to undesirable complications. Fortunately, strategies 
exist to help reduce the risk of diabetes. Even if a genetic predisposition to type 2 
diabetes is present, an environmental trigger is usually required to express it. Putting 
on excess weight has been identified as the major trigger for this type of diabetes. 
Obesity is a precursor condition of not only type 2 diabetes, but also of coronary 
heart disease, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and possibly other chronic dis -
eases, such as sleep apnea, arthritis, and related joint problems. So, avoiding obesity 
has many significant health benefits, including increased longevity.
Losing excess weight and keeping it off, however, is an extremely difficult task 
for most people, in part because weight-  loss diets are difficult to maintain over the 
long run. The word diet actually comes from the Greek language and originally 
meant “the usual food and drink one typically consumes.” Today, the word diet typi-
cally refers to a repeated pattern of on-  and- off- again dieting, and losing and gain -
ing weight, often referred to as yo-  yo dieting. Diets can be unhealthy if they focus 
mainly on weight loss and not on ensuring adequate intakes of micronutrients in 
support of overall health. Many diets, especially fad diets, are too rigid, eliminate 
certain foods or whole food groups, and often require a lot of time and effort to 
follow. Healthy diets contain a variety of foods from different food groups, which 
provide a wide range of nutrients (i.e., vitamins and minerals) and other nonnutrient 
substances (i.e., fiber and phytochemicals) needed by the body for optimal health. 
On the other hand, adding supplements to a poor diet cannot make up for the vast 
array of important nutrients and phytochemicals found in foods, especially in plant 
foods. Specific dietary recommendations based on the Mediterranean way of eating 
are provided in Chapters 8 through 16. See Chapters 17 and 18 for easy ways to begin 
incorporating a Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern in your own daily life.

OTHER FACTORS THAT PLAY A ROLE IN OBESITY 
AND TYPE 2 DIABETES
MAgnesiu M
A few minerals, magnesium in particular, have been examined in relation to their 
role in lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. Findings from 
several studies suggest an association between low serum magnesium and diabetes. 
Serum magnesium deficits have been reported in 25% to 39% of diabetic outpatients 
in the United States and Switzerland and up to 73% in Mexico. Magnesium deficit 
may be one possible underlying mechanism for the insulin resistance found in pre -
diabetes and type 2 diabetes, as well as play a role in other chronic diseases, such as 
hypertension and metabolic syndrome.
Findings from a prospective cohort study with a 6-year follow-  up support a pro -
tective role for dietary magnesium, along with whole grains and cereal fiber, in the 
development of type 2 diabetes in older women. A magnesium-  rich diet was also 
shown to reduce the relative risk of developing diabetes by 34% in women and 33% 
in men, all participants in the Nurses’ Health and the Health Professionals Follow-  Up 
Study. Results from these studies are based on food sources of magnesium and not 
on magnesium supplements. Another large, long-  term study in young American 
adults without diabetes found a lower incidence of diabetes, mainly type 2, in those 
participants who consumed the most magnesium. Higher magnesium intakes are 
also associated with lower systemic inflammation. Good food sources of magne -
sium include dark-  green, leafy vegetables, especially spinach; whole-  grain foods; 
legumes; and nuts, especially almonds, all of which are abundant in Mediterranean 
dietary patterns.
dietAry fiber
Population studies suggest that fiber-  rich diets containing a variety of plant foods are 
beneficial to health and offer protection against several chronic diseases, including 
type 2 diabetes. There are two major types of fiber: insoluble and soluble. Most plant 
foods contain both types, with one or the other predominating. Both types of fiber 
are important and contribute to health in different ways.
Foods naturally high in fiber are typically lower in fat and calories and may help 
with weight management. Fiber-  rich foods tend to stay in the stomach for a longer 
time than low-  fiber foods and thus contribute to a feeling of fullness, which lessens 
the need to eat larger amounts of food or to eat more often.
Foods high in soluble fibers typically reduce the elevation of blood glucose con -
centrations after meals. The soluble fiber molecules form gels with water in the 
gastro  intestinal tract, which slows gastric emptying. The more slowly released par -
tially digested food particles enter the small intestine, where the fiber molecules also 
slow digestion. As a result, glucose absorption into the blood is delayed and elicits a 
more moderate rise in blood glucose concentration along with a reduced blood insu -
lin response during the postmeal period.55 Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
glyce Mic index
The consumption of foods that contain carbohydrate (i.e., sugars, starches, and fiber), 
such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains, can have a major impact on blood 
sugar (i.e., glucose) concentrations. High-  glycemic foods cause a rapid increase in 
blood glucose concentration after ingestion, which signals the pancreas to release 
insulin. High insulin levels are associated with weight gain, high cholesterol levels, 
and high blood pressure and can lead to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is con -
sidered to be a major determinant of abnormal glucose tolerance and later of type 2 
diabetes itself.
The glycemic index (GI) ranks individual foods based primarily on how much 
they affect blood glucose concentrations. The glycemic load (GL) indicates the 
total amount of carbohydrate consumed in a specific portion of a food or in a meal. 
Table 4.3  provides a list of several high-  glycemic foods, and Table 4.4 gives a list of 
several low-  glycemic foods. Low GI foods typically are considered to have a value 
of 55 or lower, whereas high GI foods are considered to have a value of 70 or greater. 
Moderate GI foods fall between these values. These values are only approximate 
as they differ slightly depending on the information source. It is best to focus on 
whether a food is in a low or high range of values rather than obsessing over an 
exact number.
The usefulness of the GI in relation to issues such as weight management and 
type 2 diabetes has been questioned. Many different factors may affect the body’s 
response to specific carbohydrate-  rich foods, such as whether the food is eaten alone

processing, in general, lowers the fiber content. Foods high in fiber often have a 
lower GI. A few foods without fiber, however, such as milk and plain yogurt, also 
have a low GI. Clinical trials and epidemiologic studies of the GI have produced 
inconsistent results and provide minimal evidence to indicate that following a low TABLE  4.4

GI meal plan contributes in any significant way to weight loss or reduced type 2 
diabetes risk. However, a meal plan that includes some healthy  low GI foods, along 
with appropriate portion sizes , may provide some small additional benefit in weight 
management and prevention of type 2 diabetes. Individuals also can have unique 
reactions to certain foods and thus may find it helpful to use the GI in fine-  tuning 
their dietary plan.
Highlight: A meal plan that includes some healthy  low GI foods, along with 
appropriate portion sizes , may provide some small additional benefit in weight

The glycemic index (GI) refers to the rise in serum glucose concentration from 
baseline (fasting) following the ingestion of a single carbohydrate (glucose)-
rich food item (experimental food) in comparison to the glucose rise following 
the consumption of the same amount of glucose itself, which is arbitrarily 
assigned a GI value of 100%. A few of the common processed cereal grains 
containing little or no dietary fiber have high GI values similar to white 
bread. Other carbohydrate-  rich foods, especially legumes, vegetables, grains, 
and certain fruits, typically have lower GI values because they contain more 
dietary fiber.
An example of a meal with three fairly high-  carbohydrate food items 
includes the following: one white hamburger roll (equivalent to two slices of 
white bread), plus 0.5 pint of skim milk, plus a serving of chocolate pudding 
(Jello® brand). The total glucose of this meal is the sum of the multiplied GIs 
times the grams of each food item, as follows:
Roll (white bread)a: 2 × 12 g carbohydrate (starch) = 24 g × 0.77 = 18.6
Milk (low fat): 1 × 12 g lactose = 12 g × 0.30 = 03.6
Pudding (milk): 1 × 28 g lactose + sucrose = 28 g × 0.57 = 16.0
 Total glucose = 38.2 gb
a Equivalent to two slices of white bread.
b When 38.2 is multiplied by 4 kcal/ g, the total amount of energy from carbohy -
drates is 152.2 kcal.
The rise in blood glucose from this meal would be fairly robust, but the 
glucose response would be even greater if the energy macronutrients in the 
meal provided 100% glucose (64 g) and therefore, contained no dietary fiber 
in the meal.58 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
SUMMARY
The greatly increasing incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the United States 
and in many other countries has heightened interest in discovering dietary patterns 
to help in counteracting these unhealthy trends. Disease rates, such as for obesity and 
type 2 diabetes, have traditionally been low in most nations of the Mediterranean 
region. Lower disease rates have been attributed, in part, to both the types  and 
amounts  of foods typically consumed. A Mediterranean plant-  based diet empha -
sizes minimally processed whole foods, without supplements, as was traditionally 
consumed in reasonable amounts at family meals, with little or no snacking through -
out the rest of the day. Excessive food intake, a more recent trend in many nations, 
is known to contribute to excessive weight gain and eventually to obesity and then 
typically to type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases.
Following a healthy eating pattern that can be maintained over time, rather than 
on dieting per se, is essential for managing weight and reducing the risk of type 2 
diabetes. Strong evidence currently exists to recommend a Mediterranean dietary 
pattern for both the promotion of health and the prevention of these serious medi -
cal conditions.59
5Cardiovascular Diseases 
and the Metabolic 
Syndrome
INTRODUCTION
Mediterranean diets have increasingly been found to exert beneficial effects on reduc -
ing risks of many chronic diseases and other serious health problems. Considerable 
scientific evidence supports the significant contributions made by a Mediterranean- 
style dietary pattern concerning cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and the metabolic 
syndrome. Although some of the same diet-  induced pathologic changes found in 
individuals with type 2 diabetes also occur, other diet-  induced changes in the heart 
and arteries specifically affect cardiovascular function.
This chapter briefly provides the biological groundwork for understanding the 
linkages between diet and CVDs and the metabolic syndrome. Chapters 7 through 
16 address the specific components of a Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern that 
help prevent and, in some cases, even reverse these serious chronic conditions that 
are so prevalent.
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
Cardiovascular diseases comprise a category of disorders that affect the heart and 
blood vessels and include coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and peripheral arte -
rial disease (PAD). The good news is that overall death rates for CVDs have been 
decreasing in the United States starting in the last decades of the twentieth century. 
The bad news is that these CVD improvements may be offset by increasing rates 
of obesity and type 2 diabetes that contribute to heart disease and the metabolic 
syndrome. In addition, CVDs continue to be among the leading causes of morbidity 
and mortality of U.S. adults. Only recently have cancer rates slightly exceeded heart 
disease rates. Whereas CVDs are typically more common among older adults, the 
death rates from heart disease among young people between the ages of 15 and 34 
have been climbing.
Highlight: Whereas CVDs are typically more common among older adults, the 
death rates from heart disease among young people between the ages of 15 and 
34 have been climbing.60 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Currently, more than one in three adults in the United States has at least one type 
of CVD, resulting in an enormous burden on the nation’s total health care costs. 
Health care spending and lost productivity from CVDs exceed $400 billion a year. 
This staggering cost is likely to continue to grow as a result of the aging population 
and the obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics. Established and effective dietary pre -
vention strategies that have not been fully utilized might contribute to reducing the 
spiraling costs of health care.
Preventing and controlling high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol play a 
significant role in decreasing the risk for CVDs. A 10% reduction in total blood cho -
lesterol levels in the U.S. population has been estimated to result in a 30% decrease 
in the U.S. heart disease rate. Similarly, over the last decade, a 12- to 13-point reduc -
tion in systolic blood pressure is estimated to decrease the risk of heart disease by 
21%, the risk of stroke by 37%, and the risk for death from heart disease or stroke 
by 25%. Individuals with high serum cholesterol or high blood pressure also face the 
possibility of numerous other health-  related problems.
Highlight: A 10% reduction in total blood cholesterol levels in the U.S. popula -
tion has been estimated to result in a 30% decrease in the U.S. heart disease rate.
SERUM LIPIDS, ATHEROSCLEROSIS, AND ARTERIAL WALL DAMAGE
As a result of an excessive intake of macronutrients that generate energy (calories), 
serum lipid concentrations become significantly increased as lipoprotein fractions 
in the blood are modified. In addition, low-  density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-  C) 
molecules that circulate in blood for weeks at a time increase in concentration and 
become increasingly susceptible to oxidation. Oxidized LDL-  C acts on arterial 
walls and further contributes to pathological damage of the arteries. The damage 
to arterial walls is common in both atherosclerosis, characterized by fatty deposits in 
arterial walls, and in type 2 diabetes. As a fatty plaque accumulates on the luminal 
surface of a vessel, the lumen size decreases, and the smooth laminar flow of blood 
no longer exists. Clots are much more likely to form at the point of flow disruption. 
Several additional factors, including an elevation of serum insulin, contribute to the 
underlying cellular damage and the abnormal blood lipid pattern (i.e., dyslipidemia) 
and add to the damage of endothelial cells in the intimal layer of arteries. Damage to 
the wall of the artery is increased as other cells invade and destroy the architectural 
integrity of the vessel (Figure 5.1) and protrude even more into the lumen to disrupt 
blood flow. Research findings from several studies have shown that adhering to a 
Mediterranean dietary pattern lowers the risk of CVDs and lowers mortality.
Highlight: As a result of an excessive intake of macronutrients that generate 
energy (calories), serum lipid concentrations become significantly increased as 
lipoprotein fractions in the blood are modified.61 Cardiovascular Diseases and the Metabolic Syndrome
The inflammatory response of an artery under these conditions also contributes 
to further pathological changes of the vessel wall as different types of white cells are 
attracted to the damaged wall tissue. As long as the blood lipids remain elevated, 
arterial walls remain under attack by so-  called defense cells, such as macrophages, 
that pathologically modify the arterial wall. Arteries that have such major damage 
no longer maintain normal blood flow, and they may also begin to lose their elastic -
ity. Arterial walls, such as of the aorta, that mineralize their fatty deposits practically 
lose all of their elasticity, which reduces blood flow to the coronary arteries.
Highlight: As long as the blood lipids remain elevated, arterial walls remain 
under attack by so-  called defense cells, such as macrophages, that pathologically 
modify the arterial wall.
In addition to arterial damage to coronary arteries because of plaque formation, 
the same process occurs in arteries of the brain, the kidneys, the liver, and other 
organs. When brain vessels are damaged by fatty deposits, clots form more readily, 
and a blockage may result in a stroke, especially when blood pressure is elevated.
Strong evidence from randomized trials supports a protective relationship 
between a Mediterranean dietary pattern and CHD. Findings from the ongoing 
Multi-  Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) showed that following four life -
style behaviors (i.e., a healthy diet such as a Mediterranean diet, regular exercise, 
weight management, and not smoking) was associated with lower coronary calcium 
incidence and slower calcium progression and helped protect against early signs of

vascular disease and CHD. Study participants who adhered to these behaviors over a 
period of 7.6 years also reduced their chance of death from all causes. Other studies 
have examined the influence of a Mediterranean diet on heart rate variability (HRV). 
Reduced HRV is a risk factor for CHD. A study in middle-  aged male twins found 
that those who followed a more Mediterranean-  style diet had a higher HRV, even if 
they had a genetic predisposition to heart problems.
MAJOR DIET-  RELATED RISK FACTORS FOR HEART 
AND OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
Table 5.1 lists the major diet-  related risk factors for heart and other CVDs. Adverse 
risk factors include too much energy, which when consistent over long periods clearly 
results in increases in blood lipid risk factors and vessel wall pathologic damage. 
Omega-3 fatty acids help not only to lower blood lipids, especially triglycerides, but 
also to improve insulin sensitivity in muscle and other cell types. Micronutrients, 
especially the antioxidants, reduce the risk of damaging free radicals, such as super -
oxides, that result from normal metabolic reaction steps. The Mediterranean diets 
contain a host of these protective nutrients and phytomolecules.
THE METABOLIC SYNDROME
The metabolic syndrome, previously called syndrome X and the insulin resistance 
syndrome, refers to a group of risk factors for CVDs and type 2 diabetes and their 
association with peripheral insulin resistance. Whether this group of risk factors 
constitutes a true syndrome with a common underlying pathology is a matter of some 
controversy. The term metabolic syndrome , however, is useful in that its presence 
indicates a significant health risk to individuals.
Over the past decade, various health organizations have proposed slightly differ -
ent diagnostic criteria to identify the presence of metabolic syndrome in individuals.

Published by the American Heart Association (AHA); the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute (NHLBI); and other medical organizations, most definitions of the 
metabolic syndrome include measures of central (abdominal) obesity, triglycerides, 
high-  density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting blood glu -
cose. The metabolic syndrome is typically diagnosed when an individual has three 
or more abnormal findings out of these five measures (Box 5.1).
Relatively few studies have examined the effect of adherence to a Mediterranean- 
style diet concerning the prevalence and incidence of the metabolic syndrome. A 
meta-  analysis of 50 studies and 534,906 individuals showed that a Mediterranean- 
style diet was associated with reduced risk of metabolic syndrome. In addition, this 
study revealed protective roles of a Mediterranean-  style diet on the individual com -
ponents of metabolic syndrome, including waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, 
triglycerides, blood pressure, and glucose concentration. This study also indicated 
that a Mediterranean-type diet can be easily adopted by different cultures and can be 
cost effective in prevention of the metabolic syndrome and its components.
The term cardiometabolic risk  includes not only metabolic syndrome but also 
takes into account other risk factors, such as smoking, elevated LDL-  C, and inflam -
matory markers, not typically included in most definitions of metabolic syndrome. 
Each of the modifiable cardiometabolic risk factors contributes to a major increase 
in risk for CVDs and type 2 diabetes and their related complications (Box  5.1). 
Prevention, the first line of defense against these debilitating medical conditions, 
saves lives and money. Having a healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, being 
physically active, and making nutritious food choices in reasonable amounts, greatly 
reduces the risks for developing metabolic syndrome and CVDs, as well as type 2 
diabetes and other chronic diseases. If an individual already has one or more chronic BOX 5.1 METABOLIC SYNDROME CRITERIA
The American Heart Association (AHA) and the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute (NHLBI) define metabolic syndrome in individuals as the 
presence of three or more of the following risk factors:
• Waist circumference of at least 40 inches (102 cm) in men or 35 inches 
(89 cm) in women
• Triglyceride level of at least 150 mg/  dL

PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES 
AND METABOLIC SYNDROME
Macronutrient excess seems to be the major nutritional issue for the development 
of the CVDs in Western nations, somewhat independent of the proportions (%) 
of the three dietary macronutrients. If energy balance is maintained (i.e., Intake 
amount = Expenditure in daily activities), and body weight remains fairly constant 
during adulthood, then the percentage distribution of calories may not matter that 
much. If energy intake is excessive, however, then two macronutrients, carbohy -
drates and fats, contribute primarily to the adverse increases in serum lipid and 
serum glucose concentrations, the major risk factors for CVDs and type 2 diabetes. 
The specific lipid profile may also have an impact on the development of CVDs, as it 
has long been known that saturated fatty acids and trans-  fatty acids help to increase 
serum total cholesterol concentration, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids have an 
opposite effect. It is now also known that the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 
need to be consumed in sufficient amounts to counter the actions—often deleteri -
ous—of too much omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet (see Chapter 8). 
Monounsaturated fatty acids provide other health benefits. A Mediterranean-  style 
dietary pattern provides good amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, especially from fish 
and other seafood, as well as monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly from olive oil 
(see Chapter 12).
Highlight: It is now also known that the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 
need to be consumed in sufficient amounts to counter the actions—often 
deleterious—of too much omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet.
Some micronutrients, including vitamin C, vitamin E, β- carotene, and selenium, 
may also help prevent CVDs because of their role as antioxidants. Micronutrients 
in food provide significant health benefits, whereas the micronutrients in vitamin 
supplements generally have not been shown to improve health outcomes. In addition, 
some vitamin supplements may even cause harm, especially in large amounts. So, 
diets rich in plant foods, along with small amounts of some animal foods, such as 
found in Mediterranean-  style diets, may offer additional protection against CVDs, 
as well as other chronic diseases.65 Cardiovascular Diseases and the Metabolic Syndrome
Dietary prevention of stroke, as for the prevention of heart attack, is based on 
healthy diets that are rich in plant foods, especially a variety of fruits and vege -
tables. Magnesium-  rich foods, such as dark leafy greens, soybeans, sesame seeds, 
almonds, brown rice, quinoa, halibut and mackerel, and dark chocolate, may also 
help reduce blood pressure and lower stroke risk. In addition, modest amounts of 
alcohol have been shown to lower the risk of stroke (see separate section on alcohol).
When a Mediterranean-  style diet replaces a typical Western-  style pattern of eat -
ing (i.e., more meat and prepared food and fewer fruits and vegetables), and it is fol -
lowed for several years or longer, heart disease may be delayed or prevented. A major 
benefit is a lower total blood cholesterol concentration, which also reduces the risk 
of a second heart attack and a worsening of metabolic syndrome. All of these posi -
tive changes add up to better weight control, a healthier life, and improved longevity.
Highlight: When a Mediterranean-  style diet replaces a typical Western-  style 
pattern of eating (i.e., more meat and prepared food and fewer fruits and vegeta -
bles), and it is followed for several years or longer, heart disease may be delayed 
or prevented.
Spanish researchers in the PREDIMED study reported that people at high risk 
for CVD who followed a Mediterranean-  style diet, either with extra olive oil or 
extra nuts, had a lower risk of cardiovascular events (mostly stroke) than those on a 
slightly lower-  fat typical Mediterranean-  style diet. The participants consuming extra 
olive oil or nuts also ate slightly more fish and legumes than the control group. Olive 
oil provided beneficial monounsaturated fatty acids, and the nut mixture (almonds, 
hazelnuts, and walnuts) provided healthy omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and 
monounsaturated fatty acids. The study subjects maintained their weight, most likely 
by reducing their intake of certain other foods.
Some confusion surrounded this study because of inaccuracies reported in the 
media and a misinterpretation of the results. Nevertheless, the PREDIMED study 
is important because it had a rigorous design that randomly assigned nearly 7,500 
people to one of three diets that continued for almost 5 years. This study and its 
findings are also important because they add to the ever-  growing body of scientific 
evidence that following a Mediterranean diet is likely to lower risk of CVDs as well 
as other chronic diseases.
INTACT VERSUS ISOLATED DIETARY FI BER
Both soluble and insoluble fibers provide several health benefits through their actions 
within the gastrointestinal tract, and they likely play a role, either directly or indi -
rectly, in reducing risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes as well as in weight 
management. In general, plant foods help lower serum cholesterol concentration 
by two mechanisms: (1) Dietary fiber molecules in plant foods contribute to reduc -
tions in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol from animal foods, thereby lowering 
serum total cholesterol; and (2) plant foods do not contain cholesterol in their cell 66 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
membranes, but rather other sterols (i.e., phytosterols) unique to plant foods that also 
help lower serum cholesterol concentration.
Highlight: In general, plant foods help lower serum cholesterol concentration by 
two mechanisms: dietary fiber and phytosterols.
Studies have shown that a high intake of total dietary fiber, from soluble and insol -
uble fibers, is linked with a lower risk of heart disease (see Chapters 9 through 11). 
Because dietary fiber appears to provide numerous health benefits, food companies 
have begun to add fiber isolated from various plant sources to products that never 
contained any fiber in the first place, such as ice cream, yogurt, and juice. Some of 
the more popular isolated fibers include inulin (from the chicory plant), polydextrose, 
maltodextrin, and soy fiber. It is unclear at this time whether isolated fibers provide 
the same protection against CVDs as do intact fibers. One exception is a psyllium 
seed extract, which has been shown to help lower cholesterol as well as act as a laxa -
tive. In general, isolated fibers lack many of the nutrients and phytochemicals found 
in whole grains, and at present little or no evidence exists that isolated fibers can 
reduce the risk of CVD or type 2 diabetes.

tection against CVDs as do intact fibers. One exception is a psyllium seed extract, 
which has been shown to help lower cholesterol as well as act as a laxative.
ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
Substantial evidence from numerous types of studies indicates an inverse relation -
ship between moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages and CVD risk. Findings 
from some studies suggest that men who regularly consume two alcoholic drinks a 
day and women who regularly consume one alcoholic drink a day may have a lower 
risk of heart disease compared to nondrinkers. The benefit of moderate alcohol con -
sumption associated with various endpoints includes a lower risk of total mortality, 
CVD death, CVD, heart attack (myocardial infarction, MI), fatal MI, and CHD.
Highlight: Findings from some studies suggest that men who regularly consume 
two alcoholic drinks a day and women who regularly consume one alcoholic 
drink a day may have a lower risk of heart disease compared to nondrinkers.
Alcohol intake and CVD risk were analyzed in large representative samples of the 
U.S. population between 1987 and 2000 by the National Health Interview Survey. 
Findings suggested that light and moderate drinkers had significantly lower risk of 67 Cardiovascular Diseases and the Metabolic Syndrome
death from CVD than did alcohol abstainers and heavy drinkers. Moderate drinkers 
had about a 40% reduction in risk, and light drinkers had almost the same reduc -
tion in risk. Both men and women in different age categories had a similar pattern 
of reduction.
A comprehensive systematic review and meta-  analysis of studies examining the 
association of alcohol intake with CVD found that light-  to- moderate alcohol intake 
was associated with a reduced risk of multiple cardiovascular outcomes. The low -
est risk of CHD mortality was found in those individuals having one to two drinks 
a day, but the lowest risk for stroke mortality was found in those individuals having 
one drink or less per day.
Any potential heart benefit gained from alcoholic consumption rests strongly on 
moderate  consumption. Excessive alcohol intake is associated with multiple well- 
known adverse health effects. It may make hypertension harder to control, be associ -
ated with cardiac arrhythmias, and lead to heart failure. See Chapter 15 for specific 
information on alcohol in the diet and its positive and negative effects in relation to 
various chronic diseases.

SUMMARY
Cardiovascular diseases  are the leading cause of death in the United States as well 
as in many other nations of the world. The metabolic syndrome  refers to a cluster of 
risk factors for CVDs and type 2 diabetes and their association with insulin resis -
tance. Metabolic syndrome in an individual generally is defined as the presence of 
three or more risk factors, including elevated waist circumference, reduced HDL 
cholesterol level, elevated triglyceride level, elevated blood pressure, and elevated 
fasting glucose level. Cardiometabolic risk  includes not only metabolic syndrome 
but also takes into consideration several additional risk factors, including smoking, 
elevated LDL-  C, and inflammatory markers. Fortunately, many of these risk factors 
are modifiable through diet and other lifestyle behavior changes.
The Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern, with its emphasis on a wide variety 
of plant-  based foods, has been shown to reduce the risks of major CVDs (coro -
nary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure) in both men and women. In fact, a 
Mediterranean-  style diet is one of the most heart-  healthy ways of eating in the world. 
Fruits and vegetables provide a multitude of vitamins and minerals, many of which 
have roles as antioxidants. In addition, fruits and vegetables contain healthful phyto -
chemicals and fiber. Whole grains; legumes (dried beans, lentils, and peas); nuts; and 
seeds also supply a variety of important micronutrients, phytochemicals, proteins, 
and fiber. Fatty fish high in omega-3 fatty acids and vegetable oils, especially mono -
unsaturated fatty acid-  rich olive oil, promote healthy blood lipid values and lower 
blood pressure measurements. Coupling these healthy foods with limited amounts 
of less-  healthy foods, such as highly processed foods and foods high in trans fats, 68 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
saturated fats, sodium, or sugars, will not only offer a way of eating that is palatable 
and easy to maintain, but that also will provide significant cardioprotective benefits.
Considerable evidence indicates that the closer an individual adheres to a 
Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern for an extended period of time, the lower the risk 
for CVDs, the metabolic syndrome, and high blood pressure. Keeping total energy 
intake equivalent to energy expenditure (i.e., maintaining a healthy “normal” adult 
weight) may be a major benefit of a plant-  food-  rich Mediterranean eating pattern.69
6Diet-  Related Cancers 
and Other Diseases
INTRODUCTION
Besides obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), several other 
diet- related chronic diseases are prevalent in the United States and other Western 
nations, including diet-  related cancers of the breast, prostate, and colon. Each of 
these diseases and disorders has a different biological origin, but insufficient intakes 
of one or more nutrients or excessive intakes of others may contribute substantially 
to their causation.
This chapter addresses the roles of diet, focusing on both nutrients and phytochem -
icals, in diet-  related cancers and other diseases and describes how Mediterranean 
dietary patterns may provide specific nutrients or other components that are consid -
ered to help prevent these diseases. Chemoprevention, with respect to cancer, refers 
to functional benefits of specific food components for cells rather than the beneficial 
effects of drugs.
DIET-  RELATED CANCERS
Major studies of the Mediterranean dietary pattern on cancer outcomes have been 
few, but they suggest a general reduction in diet-  related cancers for consumers of 
these diets (Table 6.1). In addition to diet, other lifestyle factors, such as exercise, 
may make positive contributions to health and diseases, but some lifestyle factors 
also may have adverse effects. For example, cigarette smoking remains an impor -
tant adverse factor for diet-  related cancers and lung cancer, which continue to be 
major causes of death in many Mediterranean nations. Because cancer has many 
contributing factors, both positive and adverse, researchers have had difficulty teas -
ing out specific dietary factors, such as antioxidant nutrients and phytochemicals, 
that may help reduce cancer morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, several plant 
foods common to Mediterranean diets are considered to help reduce the risks of the 
diet- related cancers, especially when used together in an overall healthy dietary pat -
tern (see below).
The associations (or linkages) between various dietary risk factors and cancer 
remain incompletely understood and somewhat speculative, but we know that nutri -
tion has an enormous impact on cell functioning in the various organ systems and 
on aging and longevity. Both excessive dietary energy (caloric intake) and fat con -
sumption have been linked to higher cancer rates. Beneficial health associations 
(i.e., lower rates of breast or colon cancer) have been suggested for diets low in fat 70 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
and high in vegetables and whole grains. Cancer causation is complex and involves 
many lifestyle factors in addition to a specific dietary intake pattern. Animal studies, 
for example, suggest that a high-  fat diet promotes breast cancer development, but the 
initiation (first event) has to have been triggered by some other factor than dietary 
fat. Specific information about dietary factors involved in human carcinogenesis 
remains difficult to establish. Differences in dietary patterns between Western and 
Asian nations may provide clues about the beneficial or adverse effects of dietary 
variables (Table 6.2). Mediterranean diets, although more Western in specific food TABLE  6.1

excessive  energy , fAt, And diet- relAted cAncers
Findings from experimental animal studies, from migration studies, and from 
other epidemiological studies have established strong associations, if not causation, 
between dietary factors and various types of cancers.
Total caloric intake  is a risk factor for cancer. Excessive caloric intake has 
recently been closely linked with cancer as a result of excessive body fat and high 
body mass index (BMI). Calorie-  restricted diets in experimental animals clearly 
have resulted in decreased tumor rates and increased longevity without any other 
treatment, but similar human studies have not been able to duplicate these reduc -
tions. Excessive body weight has been shown in epidemiologic studies to contribute 
to increased cancer rates, but linkages with specific dietary variables have not been 
found consistently.
Dietary fat  long has been suspected as a major factor in cancer causation, but data 
have failed to support a significant linkage between total fat intake and cancer. Type 
of fat , however, may be more significant for cancer causation than total fat. Animal 
data on dietary fats help distinguish these two variables. High-  fat intakes contribute 
to increased tumor rates, especially if the fat consumed is high in polyunsaturated 
fatty acids (PFAs; both omega-3 and omega-6) because the double bonds in mem -
brane components readily are attacked by free radicals. Human experimental stud -
ies, however, have not provided data that clearly link dietary fat or type of fat and 
cancer. Epidemiologic studies suggested a relationship between obesity and breast 
cancer, but data on fat per se or the specific types of fatty acids are conflicting. One 
study of a large population (cohort) in Japan, however, reported that increased fat 
consumption from meats among more affluent women contributed to significantly 
higher rates of breast cancer among those over 50 years of age. Yet, a large study in 
the United States, the Women’s Health Initiative, failed to find a significant contribu -
tion of total dietary fat to breast cancer. Human studies examining the relationship 
between type of fat, such as omega-3 fatty acids, and breast cancer have not yet been 
reported. Recent studies strongly support the hypothesis that obesity, from excessive 
energy intake relative to activity rather than fat per se, is a major factor in the devel -
opment of cancers of the breast, prostate, and possibly the colon.
Olive oil , primarily virgin oil, is considered to be a major anticarcinogenic com -
ponent of Mediterranean diets. Olive oil provides considerable amounts of mono -
unsaturated fatty acids (MFAs), mainly oleic acid, plus antioxidants. These two 
components act by different mechanisms to prevent cancer or to reduce cancer rates. 
Tumor growth and progression are decreased, according to experimental data, from 
long-  term consumption of olive oil. Cancer development may take several decades 
before it can be detected. Healthy dietary habits should begin as early in life as pos -
sible to be most effective in cancer reduction through adult life. Late-  life dietary 
changes are still thought to help protect against cancer.72 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Protein  intakes at high levels (i.e., 20% or more of total energy consumption) 
have not been found to be consistently and independently associated with cancer 
rates in epidemiologic studies. The fat association is stronger and probably masks 
any effect of protein per se because the intakes of fat and protein are highly cor -
related. In animal studies, high intakes of protein at levels several times the daily 
requirements, however, contribute to increased cancer rates. Low intakes of protein, 
on the other hand, may inhibit carcinogenesis. Human evidence on this association 
is almost nonexistent; therefore, an explanation based on protein intake is highly 
speculative. In terms of mechanisms, insulin and insulin-  like growth factors (IGFs) 
have been implicated in cancer initiation. Insulin and IGFs promote growth when 
energy intakes are adequate or excessive; hence, they may overstimulate some rap -
idly dividing cells into hyperproliferation and subsequent cancer.
The immune system is also thought to play an important role in cancer develop -
ment. The immune system, especially the cell-  mediated arm, is sensitive to deficien -
cies of the macronutrients, especially high-  quality protein, and of several vitamins and 
trace elements. The immune system (i.e., cells involved in defense against viruses 
and bacteria) may function less well when a healthful nutritional pattern is not fol -
lowed (i.e., intakes remain below the optimal range). For example, excessive energy 
intake coupled with micronutrient deficits may reduce the efficacy of the immune 
system in both the neutralization of viruses and foreign agents and in removal of 
precancerous and cancerous cells. Viruses (such as hepatitis and human papilloma 
viruses) and other infectious agents are less well defended against by the humoral 
arm (immunoglobulins and other related molecules in blood) of immune defense 
mechanisms. The cellular arm of immunity (i.e., lymphocytes and monocytes) also 
may be far less effective. The complexity of involvement of the immune system in 
cancer development should be recognized, but further development of this topic is 
beyond the scope of this text. Healthy balanced nutrition typically supports both 
arms of the immune system in their protective roles against infectious organisms 
and cancer development.
insufficient  intAkes of Micronutrients  And Antioxid Ants 
And diet- relAted cAncers
Micronutrients in the diet that protect against the development of cancer are known 
as anticarcinogens because they either counteract the action of carcinogens or 
prevent the activation or expression of carcinogens. Examples of anticarcinogens 
include β- carotene (a precursor of vitamin A), vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E, 
antioxidant food additives, selenium, and possibly a few other micronutrients. (See 
further discussion in this section for the opposite outcome in cigarette smokers who 
took antioxidant supplements.) The mechanisms by which these substances act and 
possibly interact in cancer inhibition are emerging. Although not fully established, 
a common mechanism may explain the action of many of these anticarcinogens. 
Antioxidants prevent, in theory at least, the oxidative step or steps that are appar -
ently necessary for the activation of carcinogens. Cancers may result when such 
naturally occurring micronutrient antioxidants, such as β- carotene and vitamins C 73 Diet-  Related Cancers and Other Diseases
and E, are chronically deficient in the diet. The potential cancer chemopreventive 
roles of micronutrients (i.e., vitamins and minerals), a few phytochemicals, and other 
nutrients characteristic of Mediterranean diets are listed in Table 6.3. The potential 
cancer chemopreventive roles of specific nutrients and phytochemicals are presented 
in this section.
Whole grains provide many micronutrients that have chemopreventive properties. 
Several vitamins or minerals are removed from the “germ” and “bran” fractions of 
cereals, at least in part, during the processing of wheat and other grains. Therefore, 
selected chemopreventive components are reduced by the processing, the losses 
being greater with greater processing. See Chapter 10  for more information on the 
milling process and fortification of flour.
Among the B vitamins , deficiency of dietary folic acid has been shown in epide -
miologic investigations to be associated with colonic disorders, including adenomas; 
however, other B vitamins also could play a role in the prevention of cancer. 
Therefore, folic acid and probably a few other B vitamins may need to be consumed 
at recommended dietary allowance (RDA) levels to protect against the development 
of diverse cancers. Choline, classified as a B vitamin, also may have an anticarcino -
genic role because of its chemical properties.
Vitamin C,  or ascorbic acid, also serves as an antioxidant and, hence, as an anti -
cancer nutrient. Vitamin C prevents conversion of carcinogen precursors to carcino -
gens (e.g., by blocking the modification of nitrites or nitrates to nitrosamines). It 
also serves as an antioxidant in cells and plays a role in immune defense. However, 
vitamin C has been examined for its protective role against cancer in animal stud -
ies and human populations without conclusive results. Some data suggest that lower 
cancer incidence rates, especially for gastric and esophageal cancers, are associated 
with reasonable consumption of foods containing vitamin C, but the protective role 
of vitamin C against breast cancer and other hormone-  dependent cancers has not 
been supported by epidemiologic findings. In addition to inhibiting carcinogens in 
the oral cavity and esophagus, vitamin C may help prevent cancers in the lungs and 
urinary bladder, but it does not appear to be critical in the prevention of reproduc -
tive cancers and colon cancer. Clearly, much more work is needed on the vitamin 
C– cancer linkage.TABLE  6.3

a β- Carotene and other carotenoids also function as antioxidants.74 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Vitamin E (tocopherols and tocotrienols ) protects membranes against free 
radical damage and may prevent chemically induced cancers in animals. Beta- 
hydroxytoluene (BHT) and beta-  hydroxyanisole (BHA), antioxidant food additives, 
are thought to act in a similar manner. Little human data, however, exist to make 
specific dietary recommendations for vitamin E intake. Plant foods, especially 
whole grains, remain the primary sources of vitamin E. Adults have great diffi -
culty obtaining sufficient amounts of dietary vitamin E to meet their DRIs (Dietary 
Reference Intakes), but even so, deficiency signs of this vitamin have not been found 
in practically all regions of the world. Vitamin E and β- carotene supplements were 
not found, however, to protect against cancer growths in the lungs of supplemented 
cigarette-  smoking men in Finland. These antioxidant supplements probably promote 
growth after the initiation of lung and possibly other cancers. Normal food intake of 
these antioxidant nutrients is considered safe and healthful. For example, vitamin E 
molecules in both unfortified and fortified foods are still considered to be important 
anticarcinogens (i.e., protective prior to cancer initiation). The distinction between 
food-  borne and supplemental antioxidant nutrients is critical.
An interaction between vitamins E and C operates in close association with cell 
membranes. Vitamin E is stored within the fat component of membranes and vita -
min C in the watery compartment of cells near the membranes. Vitamin C molecules 
help reduce vitamin E molecules so that they can continue to function as antioxi -
dants while vitamin C molecules are oxidized and subsequently excreted in urine. 
Vitamin E does not therefore need to be replaced in the diet on a regular basis, but 
vitamin C molecules must be replaced daily to help maintain functional vitamin E 
molecules within cell membranes.
A few macrominerals,  or bulk elements, also may serve in chemopreventive roles 
in cells. For example, a dietary deficiency of calcium (with or without sufficient vita -
min D) also may contribute to the development of colon cancer and possibly prostate 
cancer. Results of a few recent trials in the United States suggest that increasing 
dietary calcium, and increasing vitamin D, may offer some protection against colon 
cancer and possibly prostate and other cancers. A more effective use of calcium by 
BOX 6.1 ANTIOXIDANTS AND CANCER 
PREVENTION: INTERACTION BETWEEN 
VITAMINS E AND C DERIVED FROM FOODS
Vitamin E is found in cells in the fat-  soluble portions of membranes, both in 
the enveloping and internal membranes. Vitamin E molecules that are modi -
fied after taking on highly reactive oxygen species (i.e., free radicals) must be 
reduced at the membrane surfaces or interfaces with the water compartments 
of cells by vitamin C molecules, which in turn become oxidized. Vitamin C 
molecules are in solution in cell water, and the free radicals on oxidized vita -
min C may be removed by other enzyme systems in the cell to regenerate 
vitamin C. This interaction only works when sufficient dietary replacement 
(i.e., from foods) of these two vitamins occurs.75 Diet-  Related Cancers and Other Diseases
the specific cells or by a direct action of a vitamin D metabolite (the hormonal form) 
within the cells may explain how the chemoprevention of these nutrients actually 
operates. Vitamin D alone also may exert a positive effect on the immune system 
and help defend against cancer development. Further research is needed to clarify 
the roles of these two important nutrients in preventing cancer.
A few trace  minerals  may have roles as antioxidants. Selenium has an anticar -
cinogenic effect in animal models, but its role in humans is not clear. However, a 
few correlation studies have shown that selenium consumption is associated with 
reduced risks of cancer for all sites. Thus, selenium may be protective against cancer 
when consumed at safe levels (i.e., no greater than the RDAs). A few other minerals 
(e.g., zinc) act as part of a molecular complex of certain enzymes involved in control -
ling free radicals.
Iron deficiency may be related to increased rates of gastric cancers in humans, but 
insufficient data exist to make a definitive statement about the role of iron deficiency 
in cancer development. Excessive intakes of iron also have been implicated in the 
initiation of cancer through the potential role of iron in oxidation and free radical 
generation. This adverse role of excess iron remains largely speculative, however, as 
few data have accumulated in support of this hypothesis.
Other trace elements may, when deficient in the diet, contribute to increased risks 
of cancers at a variety of sites. Too few experimental and human data are available 
to draw conclusions. High intakes of the heavy metals arsenic, cadmium, and lead, 
such as from occupational exposures, have been associated with increased risks of 
cancer, but no data about cancer risk are available at normal dietary levels of expo -
sure. Zinc intakes at reasonable levels may be important for immune function and 
thereby cancer prevention.
Plant phytochemicals, such as β- carotene and other carotenoids , may have anti -
carcinogenic effects, but less evidence has been established for these antioxidants 
(see also next section). The consumption of these vitamin A precursors or carot -
enoids in foods reduces the risk of cancer by promoting a normal pattern of differ -
entiation of cells of a specific tissue. High carotenoid intakes from food sources have 
been reported in several studies to decrease oral cancers, lung cancers, and a few 
other epithelial cancers. In animal and human experiments, treatment with retinoids 
(synthetic vitamin A-  like molecules) has been demonstrated to reduce a variety of 
cancers, but vitamin A itself has not been able to reduce the rates of these cancers. 
β- Carotene supplements may be helpful for those who are not cigarette smokers. 
Food sources of carotenoids probably maintain better health because they supply 
good amounts of not only β- carotene but also other phytochemicals and natural mol -
ecules like lycopene, a type of carotenoid.
Antioxidant components of olive oil and other plant foods also may have signifi -
cant effects in the protection of cells from oxidative stress and potential initiation 
of cancer. Many of the plant molecules, although clearly not all, exert antioxidant 
effects. Antioxidant properties of the variety of plant foods can be measured in vitro 
by a standard assay procedure; berries and legumes are at the top of the list in anti -
oxidant activities. Some of the major antioxidant or anticarcinogenic phytochemical 
molecules include:76 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
• Resveratrol in wine and grape juice
• Sulfur compounds (diallyl disulfides) in garlic and onions
• Lycopene and lutein in tomatoes, watermelon, and other colored vegetables
• Ellagic acid in strawberries and raspberries
• Other polyphenols in blueberries
• Sulforaphane in broccoli
• Saponins in legumes and other plant foods
• Antiestrogenic molecules in cruciferous vegetables
• Isoflavones in soy
phytoche MicAls And diet- relAted cAncers
One mechanism of cancer prevention of phytochemicals has been suggested to be 
the phenolic plant molecules. These phenols, found in extra-  virgin olive oil and in 
other plant sources, block the synthesis of a protein involved in the onset of a cancer 
growth. Phenols also may have other actions that protect cells. Favorable results 
using phenolic molecules were obtained from studies of breast cancer cell lines in 
culture, suggesting that similar effects may occur in human tissues.
Cruciferous vegetables , including broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and mus -
tard, contain several phytochemicals, including antiestrogens. Glucosinolates, in 
particular, have been shown to have anticancer effects. The consumption of crucifers 
has been shown to reduce the risk of cancers of the stomach and lungs, but reductions 
of other cancers have not yet been established. Other plants containing glucosino -
lates are thought to have similar benefits.
Dietary fiber , a common term comprising several nonnutrient phytochemicals, 
is derived from plant cell walls and other structural elements. Two types of fiber, 
water soluble and water insoluble, have been examined for their possible role in 
reducing colon, breast, and prostate cancers. The so-  called water-  soluble fiber mol -
ecules may be more beneficial than the water-  insoluble fibers, but further evidence 
BOX 6.2 A FEW SUGGESTED ACTIONS 
OF DIETARY FIBER WITHIN THE GI TRACT
The more water-  soluble dietary fiber molecules set up gels within the lower 
small intestine and large bowel. These gels tend to solubilize some chemicals 
and keep the chemicals from being absorbed into the blood. Water-  soluble 
fibers bind to cholesterol, secondary bile acids, and other potentially damaging 
animal degradation products, and they help form gels that are enzymatically 
attacked and used as nutrients by intestinal bacteria. The more water-  insoluble 
fibers help speed the flow of undigested food components en route toward 
excretion; this increase in flow rate reduces the residency time of potentially 
carcinogenic chemicals. Other beneficial effects of water-  insoluble fiber mol -
ecules also exist within the GI tract (i.e., increasing throughput or rate of fecal 
passage in the large bowel).77 Diet-  Related Cancers and Other Diseases
is needed to make strong anticancer recommendations about specific fibers. Good 
sources of dietary fiber are found in whole grains; vegetables, especially legumes; 
fruits; and nuts. Dietary fiber intakes in the United States are typically low, as most 
of the grain-  based food products, such as white bread, rolls, and crackers, are made 
from low-  fiber, highly refined wheat flour. Dietary fiber may be protective against 
cancer through its actions leading to declines in the absorption of carcinogens from 
the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A few, but not all, animal studies supported a protec -
tive role for dietary fiber against colon cancer. Prospective human (clinical) trials 
have failed, however, to find a significant association between supplemental fiber, or 
specific types of fiber, and colon cancer.
FREE RADICALS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER
Free radicals, which are considered major factors contributing to cancer initiation, 
result from the normal metabolic activities of cells that involve oxygen. They are 
normally neutralized by dietary antioxidants. Several types of the highly reactive 
chemical species (free radicals) are generated in metabolic pathways, especially 
those operating in energy-  generating organelles within cells known as mitochon -
dria. Free radicals, such as superoxides (O2–) and hydroxyl radicals (OH–), are potent 
species that gain an extra electron that permits them to react with and damage other 
large molecules in cells, such as DNA, proteins, membrane lipids, and other macro -
molecules. The new molecular components with extra electrons then may initi -
ate damaging changes that may lead to the initiation of abnormal (cancer) cells. 
Figure 6.1  illustrates the free radical formation of a superoxide, a highly reactive and 
damaging species in cells that results from the addition of one extra electron that is 
generated in a metabolic reaction using oxygen.
Free radicals are normally rapidly neutralized in cells by protective enzyme sys -
tems that use antioxidants provided in the diet (see below). Cells contain several 
mechanisms to inactivate and eliminate these free radicals (i.e., to quench them), 
but these systems require several micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), as well as 
nonnutrient phytochemical antioxidants, to provide near-  total protection against free 
radicals (see Chapter 3).
Higher intakes of free radical scavengers or quenchers (i.e., vitamins, other micro -
nutrients, and phytochemicals) in the foods commonly consumed in Mediterranean 
diets have been demonstrated to reduce blood markers (chemicals) of exposure 
resulting from oxidative damage in cells. Garlic, olive oil, red wine, and other plant 
sources contain good amounts of the antioxidants. The markers, which now can 
be measured in circulating white blood cells, suggest that a healthy diet, such as a 
Mediterranean-  style diet, significantly may reduce the accumulation of cancer cells 
and, in general, lower cancer risk.

REDUCING THE RISK OF CANCER
Several dietary and other lifestyle behavioral changes are recommended generally 
for the reduction of cancer risk for adults, starting early in adulthood, and even ear -
lier, if possible. Of foremost importance is learning about healthy foods and consum -
ing these foods in reasonable serving sizes. A plant-  based dietary pattern according 
to Mediterranean practices provides the variety so important to health and the nutri -
ents and phytochemicals needed for the support of body functions. Whole grains 
along with fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts and seeds should be emphasized, 
while meats and dairy foods should be consumed minimally. Fish and other sea -
food, prepared in a healthful way, can be consumed several times a week as part of a 
healthy diet. Although not dietary factors per se, regular physical activity, not smok -
ing, and only moderate consumption of alcohol are additional healthy behaviors that 
help prevent cancer initiation or development.
Maintaining a healthy adult BMI (18.5 to 24.9), when coupled with regular 
physical activity, such as walking briskly for 30 minutes most days of the week, 
is probably the best advice available for the population for the prevention of all the 
chronic diseases: cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and others. 
With affluence, the healthy behaviors have been largely replaced by unhealthy prac -
tices, starting as early as elementary school age. Cancer rates are currently being 
reduced in the United States because of specific health improvements, such as reduc -
tion in tobacco use, earlier detection, and consumption of healthier diets, but still 
greater health gains are possible from diets containing more plant foods and from 
increases in regular physical activities.
See Chapter 18 for additional dietary recommendations for the prevention of diet- 
related cancers and other chronic diseases.
OTHER DIET-  RELATED DISEASES OR CONDITIONS
Several other diseases or conditions also have been considered to be preventable, at 
least in part, by the consumption of a healthy Mediterranean dietary pattern. Each of 
these diseases is briefly noted in this section.
polycystic  ovAriAn syndro Me
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is strongly related to excessive caloric intake 
rather than to deficiency of one or more specific micronutrients. PCOS  is character -
ized by two or more of the following: anovulation or too few ovulations per year, 
polycystic ovaries, and overproduction of androgen. Women with PCOS typically 
are infertile, and they have menstrual irregularities and signs of excessive androgen, 
such as masculine hair patterns on the body, loss of head hair, and acne. Metabolic 
abnormalities invariably are related to glucose handling, such as impaired glucose tol -
erance and type 2 diabetes. Risk of CVD is also greatly increased. Although genetic 
contributions to PCOS exist, dietary intake, especially consumption of lower energy, 
may alleviate the severity of the syndrome by reducing the diabetic abnormalities.79 Diet-  Related Cancers and Other Diseases
Because of its beneficial effects on glucose abnormalities, the Mediterranean diet 
may also help women with PCOS and the metabolic syndrome (see Chapter 5).
Arteri Al cAlcific Ation
Endothelial cells of arteries are directly exposed to circulating blood, and they are 
subject to uptake of circulating lipoproteins. These cells undergo atheromatous 
changes, that is, development of lipid traces and plaques in arteries, which may pro -
trude into the arterial lumen and limit or impede blood flow in the affected area. 
More severe pathology of these cells results in one type of arterial calcification 
(mineralization) known as atherosclerotic disease, the basis for more severe organ 
damage, such as for heart, brain, kidney, and other organs. The mineral deposited 
in these arteries is true bone with matrix laid down first and then the mineral phase, 
but in an inappropriate location of the body. A healthy Mediterranean-  style diet helps 
to prevent such damage to arteries throughout the body. The dietary components 
considered to promote arterial endothelial health include omega-3 fatty acids, MFAs 
(olive oil), plant sterols, and antioxidant vitamins and phytochemicals. Keeping por -
tion sizes within reason may be critical as well.
chronic  kidney diseAse
Glomerular and tubular functions tend to decline with age in most affluent nations. 
The explanation for these declines, especially reduction of glomerular filtration 
rate (GFR), has not been elucidated, but experts suggest that arteries of the kid -
neys become atheromatous and possibly calcified (see preceding discussion). Other 
adverse hormonal alterations typically follow, and hypertension is common. When 
GFR declines, calcium excretion also declines, and most of the extra calcium is 
retained in the body, typically in the soft tissues, including arteries and skin, rather 
than in bone. In this way, the vessels of major organs and the heart valves tend to 
become calcified over time as renal function declines. A Mediterranean-  style diet, 
with its emphasis on plant foods, high-  MFA and low-  SFA content, and lower overall 
energy intake, helps reduce the risk of atheromas and CVD, especially as renal func -
tion becomes less efficient with age. The plaque in renal arteries is as likely to calcify 
as the plaque in the coronary arteries and in the arteries of other organs.
brAin lesions  And brAin diseAses
The same pathological sequence of adverse arterial changes also may occur in brain 
arteries, but almost no data exist to substantiate this hypothesis (see above). The met -
abolic syndrome, characterized by abdominal obesity, altered blood lipids, and other 
physiological abnormalities, is thought to contribute to coronary artery fat deposits 
(atherosclerosis) and subsequent calcification by mechanisms similar to other arter -
ies in the body that can be directly examined. That arteries of the brain may be 
affected by the same abnormalities as other arteries seems logical. The electron 
beam computed axial tomographic (ebCT) scan of coronary arteries, for example, 80 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
generates a calcium score, derived from calcification of fat deposits, which can be 
used to categorize an individual’s risk of coronary heart disease.
The risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been reported to be reduced 
by adherence to a Mediterranean-  style diet. In addition, conversion of MCI to 
Alzheimer’s disease was found to be reduced. Besides Alzheimer’s disease or 
dementia, Parkinson’s disease has been reported to benefit from the consumption of 
a Mediterranean dietary pattern. Further investigations of these diseases are needed 
to clarify diet–  brain disease relationships. The diets of Alzheimer’s patients may 
benefit from intakes of low energy and low amounts of animal fat, as well as greater 
intakes of fish and vegetable oils as well as a variety of plant-  rich foods containing 
micronutrients and phytochemicals (i.e., the Mediterranean pattern of eating). In 
addition to a favorable intake of nutrients and phytochemicals from a Mediterranean 
diet in protecting against cognitive decline, dementia, and related conditions, posi -
tive lifestyle factors also seem to contribute to better health of these individuals.
Depression, another brain complication, may also be affected by unhealthy diets, 
especially intakes that are low or deficient in fish and fish oils rich in omega-3 fatty 
acids and dark-  green leafy vegetables rich in folic acid, other micronutrients, and 
phytomolecules. Excessive caloric intakes and saturated fats may contribute to 
late- life depression through promotion of atherosclerosis and possibly calcification 
of arteries. This metabolic form of vascular depression differs from other forms of 
depression, which do not seem to have dietary-  induced arterial damage.
Although not yet established, many brain-  related declines in function may be asso -
ciated with declines in cardiovascular function, especially arterial roles. Cognition 
may be improved by nutrients provided in a healthy diet. A Mediterranean dietary 
pattern is more effective in reducing these declines than practically any other 
dietary approach to eating.
Age- relAted MAculAr degener Ation
A Mediterranean dietary pattern has been reported to reduce the risk of developing 
age- related macular degeneration (AMD) in older adults. Omega-3 fatty acids from 
fatty fish and nuts, especially walnuts, may protect the eyes by reducing accumula -
tion of plaque in the arteries of the eyes, thereby reducing the risk of AMD. Olive 
oil, however, contains only limited amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, while being 
rich in healthy MFAs. (Although not part of traditional Mediterranean diets, canola 
oil and flaxseed also provide good amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.) Phytochemical 
antioxidants present in olive oil and other plant sources (i.e., major food sources in 
Mediterranean diets) also are considered chemopreventive.
The reduction of both AMD and cataracts, or perhaps their delay, may be enhanced 
by a diet rich in carotenoids and plant polyphenols. Both types of molecules act as 
antioxidants that help lower inflammation in eye and other tissues. These molecules 
have been likened to “sun screens” within the eyes that keep out damaging UV 
light from the sun. Other nutrients, such as vitamins C and E, selenium, zinc, and 
phytochemical antioxidants, especially carotenoids, also may have eye health main -
tenance properties. Again, plant foods that are rich in these nutrients, polyphenols, 81 Diet-  Related Cancers and Other Diseases
and omega-3 fatty acids should be included in the diet practically every day, as they 
are by Mediterraneans.
iMMune defense
The immune system contains several diverse cell types, which may benefit from the 
Mediterranean style of eating because of the many micronutrients and phytochemi -
cals consumed as part of these diverse diets. Omega-3 fatty acids may exert positive 
effects on cells that process viruses and bacteria by reducing local inflammatory 
responses. The anti-  inflammatory effects of fish oils are considered to have similar 
results. More research on this issue, however, is needed before conclusive statements 
can be made about the beneficial effects of Mediterranean diets on immune defense 
against micro  organ  isms and cancer.
decline  in bone MAss And osteoporosis
Recent evidence suggests that late-  life bone loss, first osteopenia and then osteoporo -
sis, may be prevented in postmenopausal women, at least in part, by a Mediterranean 
dietary pattern. Several nutrients in Mediterranean diets may contribute to beneficial 
skeletal effects. Calcium is generally fairly high and bioavailable in greens, such 
as broccoli and kale. Some fish, such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel, have good 
amounts of vitamin D. Although cod-  liver oil is rich in vitamin D, it also may pro -
vide too much vitamin A, which has been implicated as a risk factor for hip frac -
tures. Small fish with edible bones, such as sardines and herring, as well as the soft 
bones in canned salmon, also contain considerable amounts of calcium. Low-  fat 
dairy products, such as plain yogurt, light cheeses, and feta cheese, also are good 
sources of calcium and, in fortified dairy products, of vitamin D (see Chapter 14).
A second line of investigation on the potential beneficial effects of the 
Mediterranean dietary pattern on the skeleton relates to fat intake. Higher intakes 
of omega-3 fatty acids in fish, and possibly MFAs in olive oil and vitamin E in plant 
foods, may be factors that enhance bone formation and reduce bone resorption.
Soybeans, a nontraditional legume of Mediterranean-  style diets, contain isofla -
vones that may help maintain bone mass and density, hence strength, by reducing 
bone resorption and increasing bone formation of older adults. Supplemental iso -
flavones, however, have not been recommended because too few randomized con -
trolled trials have been conducted to know what optimal doses might be. Although 
isoflavones are considered reasonably safe when consumed in soy foods, the effec -
tiveness of these molecules, as supplements, in maintaining bone density and pre -
venting fractures remains to be established.
See Chapters 7 through 16 for dietary recommendations that may help prevent the 
risks of these chronic diseases or disorders.
SUMMARY
In summary, micronutrients, particularly the antioxidant nutrients (vitamins C and 
E, β- carotene, and selenium); phytochemicals; and dietary fiber, when consumed in 82 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
appropriate amounts, are considered to be the major components in the Mediterranean 
dietary pattern to be chemopreventive against diet-  related cancers and possibly some 
other cancers. Macronutrients, when consumed in modest amounts and of the rec -
ommended types, also remain important for disease prevention. The associations 
(or linkages) between various dietary risk factors and cancer remain incomplete and 
somewhat speculative, but we know that nutrition has an enormous impact on growth 
and development, the functioning of the various organ systems, and aging and lon -
gevity. An exception to these statements about the role of antioxidants in cancer 
prevention, when given as supplements, occurred in a study of Finnish men with a 
long-  term history of smoking tobacco. In this prospective randomized controlled 
trial, evidence was found of increased  lung cancer rates and possibly other cancers 
rates as well.
The overall cancer rates in the United States possibly could be reduced by one-  third 
through the adoption of a Mediterranean dietary pattern. In addition, a healthier life -
style, especially increasing physical activity on a regular basis each week, could have 
another 20% reduction in overall cancer rates in the United States. An estimated 33% 
decline of the cancer rates previously had been predicted based on total abolition of 
use of all types of tobacco, and lung cancer rates have indeed declined as cigarette 
smoking has been greatly reduced in the United States. These estimated reductions 
are based on the sharp decline in U.S. stomach cancer rates observed over the twenti -
eth century, a drop related to a higher quality of food and reductions in the consump -
tion of salt-  preserved foods. Japan also has had greatly lowered gastric cancer rates 
in the last half of the twentieth century that are attributed to a major decrease in the 
use of salt-  preserved foods, such as fish and vegetables, and an increase in the use of 
refrigeration for “cold” preservation of these foods.
The increase in the number of servings of fruits and vegetables to nine per day, 
now the current recommendation in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans , as illus -
trated in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Pyramid, is based on a 
2,000-kcal diet. The current U.S. recommendations come much closer to the dietary 
patterns practiced in many of the Mediterranean nations. Followers of the cam -
paign Fruits & Veggies—More Matters™ increase their intakes of plant foods that 
help them avoid or delay common cancers now so prevalent in the United States. 
A Mediterranean-  style diet is about as good as possible for reducing cancer rates, 
but other diets rich in a variety of plant foods, such as the Okinawa diet, may offer 
similar benefits to health.
Several chronic diseases or conditions, in addition to diet-  related cancers, may be 
prevented or delayed by the long-  term consumption of a Mediterranean dietary pat -
tern. The metabolic syndrome, covered previously (see Chapter 5), includes several 
of these other chronic diseases, including inflammatory markers. Arterial calcifi -
cation that sequentially follows atherosclerotic plaque formation in the heart and 
other organs of the body, including possibly the brain and kidneys, may increase risk 
for a number of diseases common in late adulthood, especially during the elderly 
years. The Mediterranean-  style diet, with its focus on plant foods and olive oil rather 
than other fats, provides many healthful micronutrients plus diverse phytochemicals, 
whose roles are being elucidated in the present era of research on these beneficial 
plant components.Section II

7Introduction to the 
Health Benefits of 
Mediterranean-  Style 
Dietary Patterns
INTRODUCTION
This chapter serves as an introduction to the next several chapters that focus separately 
on the various foods and food groups that figure prominently in a Mediterranean- 
style dietary pattern.
This unique dietary pattern encompasses a wide variety of palatable  foods, pro -
vides flexibility  in food choices and in macronutrient distribution to meet individual 
needs, and has been shown to be sustainable  over time. Most important, adher -
ence to this dietary pattern is associated with a reduced incidence of obesity, type 2 
diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, the metabolic syndrome, diet-  related cancers, and 
other chronic diseases. The early report of these health benefits, especially of the 
heart, by Christakis in 1965 initiated additional investigations throughout the fol -
lowing decades that continued to expand our knowledge of why Mediterranean diets 
had such a strong positive effect on health.  Considerable evidence indicates that the 
closer one follows this way of eating, the lower the risk is for these chronic diseases.
A Mediterranean dietary pattern is used increasingly for weight management 
as it supplies all the nutrients necessary to help ensure healthy weight loss when 
consumed in  moderate amounts . Even if an individual makes healthy food choices, 
consuming more calories than needed will lead to an increase in weight.
Consistent with a Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern, this chapter and Chapters 8 
through 16  provide dietary recommendations that have been supported by findings 
from published peer-  reviewed scientific research.
BALANCED CALORIC INTAKE
A traditional Mediterranean way of living typically balances total caloric intake 
(i.e., energy from the macronutrients) with total energy expenditure (i.e., through an 
active lifestyle) to help manage weight in adults. Although the distribution of energy 
obtained from the three macronutrients may not be precisely established, the standard 
percentages often recommended are approximately 50% from carbohydrates, 30% 
to 35% from fat, and 15% to 20% from protein. Total caloric intake (i.e., quantity ) 
likely affects weight to a greater degree than macronutrient composition.86 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Highlight: Total caloric intake (i.e., quantity ) likely affects weight to a greater 
degree than macronutrient composition.
Excessive energy consumption clearly leads to increased storage of fat molecules, 
and a high intake of refined and highly processed carbohydrates may be the greatest 
contributor to triglyceride (TG) or fat production in both adipose (fat) and muscle 
tissues. In addition to the likelihood of weight gain, excess carbohydrate intake 
causes the pancreas to secrete more and more insulin. Over time, an elevation of 
serum insulin leads to insulin resistance by adipose and muscle tissues and hinders 
the beneficial action of insulin (i.e., moving glucose out of the bloodstream into the 
body’s cells). Therefore, these constraints on caloric intake from both dietary fats 
and carbohydrates help prevent development of the insulin-  dependent diseases, such 
as obesity and type 2 diabetes, and help delay the onset of cardiovascular diseases, 
the metabolic syndrome, diet-  related cancers, and other conditions.
CONSUMPTION OF NUTRIENTS IN APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS
As stated, a balanced intake of energy-  generating macronutrients from the basic 
food groups serves as the basis for a healthy diet. Because so many different micro -
nutrients are provided along with the macronutrients in a variety of plant and animal 
foods, recommendations for specific foods or groups of similar foods also are now 
recognized as important for promoting health and reducing risk for chronic diseases. 
Two examples of specific micronutrients illustrate the importance of consuming 
appropriate amounts from foods within their food groups—not too much or too little.
The first example is folate, a water-  soluble B vitamin. Folate is the naturally occur -
ring form in food; folic acid is the synthetic form used in fortified foods and dietary 
supplements. The best sources of naturally occurring folate come from legumes and 
many green vegetables, while cereals tend to have the highest levels within fortified 
foods. The body uses folate to help produce DNA and RNA, both critical for forming 
healthy new cells. The recommended intake for most adult men and non-  pregnant 
women is 400 micrograms per day (μg/  day).
Previously, folate deficiency  has been a major concern because of increased rates 
of neural tube birth defects. In addition, low folate consumption in both men and 
women over time may lead to megaloblastic anemia and may increase risk of some 
cancers, especially of the colon and alcohol-  related cancers. These concerns asso -
ciated with folate deficiency were somewhat alleviated when federal law in 1998 
required manufacturers of cereal and grain products to fortify these food products 
with folic acid. Recent evidence, however, suggests that excessive  folic acid con -
sumption from supplements and fortified foods may have adverse health effects, 
including a possible increased risk of some cancers, including lung and prostate as 
well as colon cancer, especially in older adults with precancerous colon polyps. High 
intakes of folic acid may mask a B12 deficiency, causing a delay in diagnosis, which 
can lead to neurological damage. Some evidence also suggests high intakes may 
increase the risk of heart attack in people who have heart problems.87 Introduction to the Health Benefits of Mediterranean-  Style Dietary Patterns
The second example is calcium, a mineral needed in large quantities on a daily 
basis. The amount of calcium needed each day, although not precisely established, is 
considered to be about 1,000 milligrams per day (mg/  day) for adults—after skeletal 
growth has ceased. The major food group that provides large amounts of calcium 
is dairy, but vegans and other individuals who do not consume milk or milk-  based 
products may find it difficult to obtain sufficient daily intakes of calcium. Fortunately, 
a number of other calcium-  containing food sources are available, including dark- 
green, leafy vegetables, calcium-  fortified orange juice, and calcium-  set tofu. Adults 
who do not consume an adequate amount of calcium may be increasing their risks 
of developing osteoporosis late in life. On the other hand, consuming more calcium 
than the recommended amounts may pose other health risks, such as calcification of 
arteries and renal stones.
EMPHASIS ON WHOLE FOODS, NOT DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS
Traditional Mediterranean-  style dietary patterns rarely contained nutritional supple -
ments, if any. Pills and other dietary supplements contain only one, or at best, several 
vitamins, minerals, or phytomolecules compared to the hundreds of beneficial ones that 
are found in foods, especially fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. The major 
health benefits derived from consuming food rather than supplements likely result from 
the synergistic effects of all the nutrients and other vital substances in foods acting 
together. Furthermore, when sorting out substances from whole food, it is not usually 
known what amount is safe to take, what amount is necessary to provide a therapeutic 
effect, or even in what ways a specific vitamin, mineral, or phytomolecule is affected 
by the presence of other substances in the whole food. Supplements do not have to 
be tested or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and may contain 
contaminants or have lower or higher amounts of a nutrient than indicated on the label.
Taking high amounts of certain vitamins, minerals, or other substances may actu -
ally cause serious adverse health effects. Besides, supplements are expensive, so put 
your money to better use by purchasing nutritious foods such as fruits, vegetables, 
legumes, and whole grains. Use nutritional supplements only when needed and in 
appropriate amounts.
MEDITERRANEAN DIETARY COMPONENTS 
THAT PROMOTE GOOD HEALTH
The basic Mediterranean dietary components include
• balanced caloric intake;
• high consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains;
• higher  consumption of monounsaturated fat than saturated fat;
• moderate  consumption of nuts, seeds, fish, seafood, and alcohol (red wine)

• low consumption of meats and milk and low- to- moderate  consumption of 
poultry, eggs, cheese, and yogurt; and

8High Consumption 
of Monounsaturated Fat 
and Low Consumption 
of Saturated Fat
INTRODUCTION
Fats and oils,  a class of lipid molecules, contain a mixture of fatty acids  in vary -
ing amounts: saturated fatty acids (SFAs), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFAs or 
PUFAs), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MFAs or MUFAs). Fats and oils are typi -
cally called by the name of the fatty acid present in the largest amount. Thus, olive 
oil is called a monounsaturated fat, while coconut oil is considered a saturated fat. 
All fats and oils, being calorie dense, have approximately 120 calories and 13–14 g 
total fat per 1 tablespoon. Some fats appear to have adverse effects on health, such 
as saturated and trans fats, while others appear to provide health benefits, such as 
monounsaturated and certain polyunsaturated fats. However, consuming more than 
the recommended amount of any fat, even a “healthy” one such as olive oil, is not 
likely to provide additional health benefits, but rather to contribute to adverse health 
effects, such as gaining excess weight.
Findings from research in Crete, a Greek island in the Mediterranean Sea, 
revealed low rates of obesity in a population that had lower saturated fat consump -
tion but higher total fat and monounsaturated fat consumption than in the United 
States and many northern European countries. This evidence from the 1950s, as well 
as from recent research findings, suggests that the types  of fat, and possibly their 
proportion  of total fat intake, may be more important than total fat per se  regarding 
weight gain and sequential pathological events.
FATTY ACID TYPES IN FATS AND OILS
Different types of fatty acids exist in plant and animal food sources. S aturated fatty 
acids (SFAs ) are found mainly in animal products, such as fatty meats and high-  fat 
dairy products, but some are found in plant foods, such as cocoa butter and coconut. 
Tropical oils, including coconut, palm, and palm kernel oils, also have high amounts 
of SFAs. This type of oil tends to be semisolid at normal room temperature, whereas 
animal fats typically remain fairly solid at normal room temperature. Coconut oil 
has been publicized recently as a superhealthy type of oil, mainly because it con -
tains more medium-  chain fatty acids, also referred to as medium-  chain triglycerides 90 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
(MCTs), compared to other oils, which have more long-  chain triglycerides (LCTs). 
MCTs are metabolized differently than LCTs, resulting in more of the fat burned 
for energy and less stored as fat. Pure MCT oil is sold as a dietary supplement and 
is often used in hospitals for critically ill patients and others who have problems 
digesting regular fats but need to have a high intake of energy. At present, however, 
the use of coconut oil has little scientific evidence to back up its “health claims,” 
which include weight loss, help curing Alzheimer’s disease, or lowering the risk 
of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Results for benefits on athletic performance are 
also inconsistent. What we do know is that several good studies provide evidence 
to back up health claims for olive oil, canola oil, and some other liquid oils lower in 
saturated fat.
While some studies show a weak association between saturated fat and increased 
risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD, it is clear from numer -
ous studies and clinical trials that a high saturated fat intake is associated closely 
with many deleterious health effects, including obesity and insulin resistance. The 
adverse effects of fat are partially linked to the excessive intake of carbohydrate 
calories, which may be converted to SFAs by the liver.  Saturated fat also raises total 
cholesterol and “bad” low-  density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol but may slightly 
raise “good” high-  density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Saturated fat, however, 
reduces the anti-  inflammatory potential of HDL cholesterol and impairs endothelial 
function of arteries. Consuming even one meal high in saturated fat may make it 
more difficult for HDL cholesterol to protect arteries over the next several hours.
When reducing saturated fat intake, an important consideration is what to substi -
tute that is healthier. Since all fats and oils yield energy and are calorically dense, it 
is important not to add more of a healthier fat to one’s usual dietary intake without 
reducing caloric intake from less-  healthy food sources. Excessive fat consump -
tion from any source will increase caloric intake and likely lead to an increase in 
unwanted weight. Strong evidence exists for replacing some saturated fat with MFAs 
or PFAs, especially omega-3 fatty acids, along with some high-  fiber, low-  glycemic, 
unrefined carbohydrate foods to reduce health risks and provide greater health ben -
efits. Reducing saturated fat intake and substituting monounsaturated fat may help 
decrease CVD risk by lowering total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentration, 
maintaining HDL cholesterol concentration, and reducing triglyceride concentra -
tion. Results from various studies also suggested substituting polyunsaturated fat for 
some saturated fat to help prevent CHD.
Monounsaturated fatty acids  (MFAs or MUFAs) found in foods mainly exist 
as omega-9 fatty acids, such as oleic acid in olive oil, the principal fat used in 
Mediterranean diets. Monounsaturated oils become liquid at normal room temper -
atures but cloud up and thicken when refrigerated. MFAs have several functions, 
including generating calories for use by cells and reducing the concentration of 
serum triglycerides, an indicator of an unhealthy diet and a risk factor for heart 
disease. Olive oil has a different fatty acid profile from all other plant oils because 
of its higher MFA content. In addition to olives and olive oil, other foods contain -
ing good amounts of MFAs include avocados, peanuts, peanut butter, pistachios, 
and almonds. Canola oil, a synthetic oil rich in omega-3 fatty acids, also has high 
amounts of MFAs.91 Consumption of Monounsaturated and Saturated Fats
Because of the health benefits conferred by MFAs, many manufacturers are find -
ing new ways to incorporate these fatty acids into products that previously contained 
high levels of saturated fats or trans fats (e.g., some types of margarines, mayon -
naise, and chocolate products). Research in other areas has resulted in producing 
certain seed oils also high in MFAs, such as mid- and high-  oleic sunflower and 
safflower oils. These oils, however, usually lack some of the beneficial antioxidant 
components, such as polyphenols, found in olive oil.
Some studies show that diets high in MFAs decrease blood glucose concentra -
tion as well as improve insulin sensitivity in individuals with type 2 diabetes, as 
compared to high-  carbohydrate diets containing the same amount of calories. Other 
studies indicate that diets high in monounsaturated fat do not lead to weight gain, 
providing that caloric intake is not excessive.
Highlight: Some studies show that diets high in MFAs decrease blood glucose 
concentration as well as improve insulin sensitivity in individuals with type 2 
diabetes, as compared to high-  carbohydrate diets containing the same amount 
of calories.
Diets high in MFAs also have been shown to provide numerous positive effects 
on various components of the cardiovascular system. These serum lipid changes 
are significant as individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes have increased 
risk of heart disease and other CVDs. Also, some patients with type 2 diabetes who 
change from a diet high in PFAs to a diet high in MFAs have shown reduced insu -
lin resistance and improved function of the endothelial cells that line the arteries. 
Individuals with early atherosclerosis also have shown improvement in endothelial 
function when olive oil was added to a healthy cardiovascular diet, potentially due 
to the effects of the high amount of polyphenols contained in olive oil. The recent 
Three-  City Study followed over 7,600 older individuals for 5 years and found a lower 
incidence for stroke in those with higher olive oil use compared to those who never 
used olive oil. Extra virgin olive oil was the main type of olive oil consumed by study 
participants. Results from a population-  based Spanish study showed that people who 
consumed olive oil (vs. sunflower oil) had a lower risk of obesity, impaired glucose 
regulation, hypertriglyceridemia, and HDL cholesterol levels.
Highlight: Diets high in MFAs also have been shown to provide numerous posi -
tive effects on various components of the cardiovascular system.
olive oils
Several kinds of olive oils exist, each with unique characteristics. All are graded in 
respect to their level of acidity, with lower acidity being more desirable. The best- 
quality olive oils are also cold-  pressed , a process that does not involve the use of 
chemicals or heat. A list of definitions of the different types of olive oils follows:92 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
• Extra- virgin olive oil (EVOO), a cold-  pressed oil, comes from the first 
pressing of the olives and has the lowest level of acidity content (i.e., no 
more than 1% acid). It has a deep color, usually gold to golden green, 
with an intense flavor and aroma. The type of olives used also affects the 
color, flavor, and aroma of the oil. EVOO is usually the most expensive, 
but because it has such a strong flavor, only a small amount is needed to 
flavor foods.
• Virgin olive oil , also a first-  pressed oil, has a higher level of acidity than 
EVOO, up to a maximum of 3%.
• Olive oil , sometimes called pure olive oil , results from a combination of 
refined olive oil and virgin or EVOO.
• Light olive oil  is highly refined. The term light refers only to color and 
fragrance. It has about the same amount of fat (14 g) and calories (120) 
per tablespoon as all other olive oils and about the same amount of MFAs. 
During refining, however, healthful substances (e.g., some polyphenols and 
vitamin E) may be reduced or totally removed. Compared to unrefined oils, 
refined oils have a higher smoke point and so can be used in high-  heat fry -
ing. EVOO and virgin olive oil are best used in cooking at low-  to- medium 
heat, such as sautéing, and in uncooked foods, such as salad dressings and 
marinades, which benefit from a pronounced flavor. Microwave heating 
also retains more of the beneficial phenolic compounds compared to cook -
ing with high heat.
The relatively stable virgin olive oil and EVOO can have a shelf life of up to 
18 months if stored appropriately. Choose opaque containers (e.g., dark-  colored glass 
rather than clear or light-  colored glass) and store in a dark place at a moderate tem -
perature that does not fluctuate greatly. In the Mediterranean diet, olive oil was often 
mixed with fresh herbs of the Lamiaceae  family (the mint family), such as rosemary, 
thyme, and oregano, and used in cooking, soups, and salads. These herbs also con -
tain phenolic compounds and provide additional antioxidant activity.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids  were consumed to a lesser extent than MFAs in tradi -
tional Mediterranean diets. Polyunsaturated fats are liquid at normal room tempera -
tures but generally become semicongealed when refrigerated. Two major types of 
PFAs exist, omega-3 and omega-6, each with unique properties.  Linoleic acid (LA), 
the parent fatty acid of omega-6 fatty acids, can be found in high amounts in many 
vegetable oils, including corn oil. Alpha-  linolenic acid (ALA), the parent fatty acid 
of omega-3 fatty acids, comes only from plant sources. High amounts are present in 
flaxseed and flaxseed oil, walnuts and walnut oil, and canola oil. In humans, ALA 
is converted to the longer carbon chain fatty acids, first to eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA) and then to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This conversion, however, is rela -
tively slow and inefficient. EPA and DHA appear to provide greater benefits to heart 
health, compared to LA and ALA, and can be found primarily in fatty, cold-  water 
fish, including salmon, albacore tuna, trout, sardines, herring, and mackerel. Some 
foods enriched with DHA, but not EPA, from algal oil are available for individuals 
who prefer to follow a vegetarian diet.93 Consumption of Monounsaturated and Saturated Fats
Although LA is recognized as an essential nutrient, the debate continues regard -
ing whether high intakes have beneficial or harmful effects on cardiovascular health. 
Until further research provides stronger evidence for optimal amounts of omega-6 
fatty acid intake, the American Heart Association supports the current dietary rec -
ommendation of 5% to 10% of energy from LA. Other dietary recommendations for 
reducing CVD risk include decreasing intakes of SFA, trans-  fatty acid, sodium, and 
highly refined carbohydrate and increasing intakes of omega-3 fatty acid and dietary 
fiber (see Chapter 3).
Less research has dealt specifically with the relationship between PFAs and risk 
of type 2 diabetes, compared with the relationship between PFAs and risk of heart 
disease. Omega-3 fatty acids, especially those from fatty fish, have been shown to 
exert favorable effects on the heart. In a review of clinical trials and randomized 
controlled trials, the findings indicate that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids is 
effective in preventing cardiovascular events, cardiac death, and coronary events, 
particularly in individuals at high cardiovascular risk. The relationship between 
PFAs and CVDs is further discussed in Chapter 12, “Moderate Consumption of Fish 
and Seafood.”
Trans-  fatty acids , or trans fats, in addition to SFAs, contribute to various adverse 
health effects. Trans fats generally are considered the unhealthiest of all dietary fats 
because they tend to end up mainly in fat of the abdomen. This type of fat forms 
when manufacturers add hydrogen atoms to liquid vegetable oils to make solid fats, 
which enable food products to have a more stable and longer shelf life. Industrially BOX 8.1 STEPS EMPLOYED IN PRODUCING VIRGIN OLIVE OIL
Basically, two types of processing of olives result from the one-  time labori -
ous preparation of virgin olive oil. The first and cruder method, which typi -
cally uses heat, yields lower-  quality olive oil that removes some of the valuable 
plant molecules in the process. The second type, which uses no heat (i.e., cold- 
pressed), retains most of the critical plant molecules (i.e., secoiridoids and 
lignans) that help protect against CVDs and some cancers. EVOO is made 
using the second type of processing. The production of EVOO requires con -
siderably more time to separate the oil from the soft tissue of the olive because 
it is done at room temperature. Modern extraction methods have shortened the 
process and increased the yield of EVOO. Although more expensive, EVOO is 
considered a much healthier choice. Double virgin olive oil, although of even 
finer quality, does not appear to be significantly better than EVOO in help -
ing to prevent chronic diseases. Specific definitions have been written into the 
European Code for the different types of virgin olive oil. For example, EVOO 
contains 1 g of oleic acid per 100 g oil; most other vegetable oils have less oleic 
acid per 100 g.

produced trans fat, nonexistent in traditional Mediterranean-  style diets, are found in 
highly refined or processed foods, as in some commercial baked goods, fried foods, 
canned frostings/  icings, margarines, microwave popcorn, and frozen pizzas. Small 
amounts of trans-  fatty acids are also produced in the gut of some grazing (ruminant) 
animals, such as cattle. The naturally occurring trans fats, found in animal products, 
such as milk and milk products and some meats, are not considered harmful in small 
amounts. Consuming many foods, or large portions of foods, that contain industri -
ally produced trans fat, however, increases the amounts of this fat to unhealthy lev -
els. Fortunately, manufacturers now have reduced the amount of trans fat contained 
in many commercial food products.
Highlight: Trans fats generally are considered the unhealthiest of all dietary fats.
In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required manufacturers 
of most conventional foods to list the trans fat content in the Nutrition Facts panel 
found on most packaged food labels. Foods containing less than 0.5 g of trans fat per 
stated serving size are allowed to list trans fat content as 0 g. However, if an individ -
ual consumes more than the listed serving size or has meals and snacks throughout 
the day with a number of foods having just under 0.5 g trans fat, it becomes likely 
that the consumption of dietary trans fat easily could exceed a safe amount. The 
American Heart Association recommends limiting daily trans fat intake to no more 
than 2 g based on a 2,000-Calorie diet (or less than 1% of total daily Calories). Other 
health-  related organizations emphasize the importance of limiting dietary trans fat 
as much as possible. If the ingredients listed on a food container show hydrogenated 
oil, the product may or may not contain trans fat. If the oil is fully hydrogenated, it 
does not contain trans fat. This does mean, however, that the saturated fat content is 
likely increased, so it is important to check the Nutrition Facts panel for the saturated 
fat amount contained in one serving, a defined size. On the other hand, if partially 
hydrogenated oil  is listed, the product does contain some trans fat, even if 0 g trans 
fat is stated on the Nutrition Facts panel.
The deleterious effect of trans fat on increased risk of type 2 diabetes was high -
lighted by findings from the Nurses’ Health Study. More than 84,000 women were 
followed for 14 years, and those consuming the most trans fat had a 30% higher risk 
of type 2 diabetes than those consuming the least. Trans fat may make cell mem -
branes more rigid than PFAs, and this abnormality may lead to increased insulin 
resistance as well as promote type 2 diabetes by increasing abdominal fat deposition.
Trans fat has a more negative impact on heart health than does saturated fat because 
it not only raises blood LDL cholesterol concentration but also reduces the particle 
size of these lipoproteins, whose increased density makes them more atherogenic. 
Trans fats have been shown to raise blood triglyceride concentration, lower HDL 
cholesterol concentration, and increase the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL choles -
terol concentration, a predictor of heart disease. In addition, trans fat may contribute 
to heart disease by increasing inflammatory factors, such as C-  reactive protein.95 Consumption of Monounsaturated and Saturated Fats
Highlight: Trans fat has a more negative impact on heart health than does satu -
rated fat because it not only raises blood LDL cholesterol concentration but also 
reduces particle size of these lipoproteins, whose increased density makes them 
more atherogenic.
Cholesterol  is a waxy, fat-  like substance found only in foods of animal origin. 
Cholesterol is usually associated with fat because it appears in foods often high in 
fat, such as egg yolk, liver, and other organ meats. In general, dietary cholesterol 
(unlike blood cholesterol) has a less-  negative impact on CVD risk than do saturated 
and trans fats.
Phytosterols  (i.e., plant sterols and stanols) have a chemical structure similar to 
cholesterol, a fat-  like substance found in all animals. Phytosterols, unlike choles -
terol, act to prevent some of the dietary cholesterol in the human digestive tract 
from being absorbed, resulting in lower blood cholesterol concentration. Plant sterols 
and stanols have been extensively studied over the past several decades. Based on 
consistent and strong research findings, the FDA authorized cardiovascular health 
claims in 2000 and 2003 for sterol and stanol esters and for free sterols. The National 
Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommends including 2 g/  day of sterols in a 
heart-  healthy diet to help reduce LDL cholesterol and lower the risk of heart disease.
Highlight: Phytosterols, unlike cholesterol, act to prevent some of the dietary 
cholesterol in the human digestive track from being absorbed, resulting in lower 
blood cholesterol concentration.
Traditional plant-  based Mediterranean diets were rich in phytosterols. Small 
amounts of these beneficial molecules are found in a wide range of plant foods. 
Today, sterols and stanols also are added to a number of different foods, including 
some margarine spreads, cooking oils, salad dressings, milk, yogurt, and juices.
See Table 8.1 for recommendations about intake of total fat and fat subgroups, 
including trans fat.
BOTTOM LINE
Multiple health benefits result from avoiding foods with added trans fats, reducing 
intake of foods containing saturated fats, and substituting foods higher in mono -
unsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, especially omega-3 polyunsaturated fats. 
These substitutions may improve insulin sensitivity and decrease blood glucose con -
centration, as well as protect components of the cardiovascular system and help sup -
port weight management. Olive oil, olives, and avocados are rich in MFAs. Omega-3 
PFAs are found in walnuts and flaxseed, but most importantly in fish oil (i.e., fatty 
fish such as salmon, sardines, trout, herring, mackerel, and albacore tuna). Canola oil 
contains good amounts of both MFAs and omega-3 PFAs.96 The Mediterranean Way of Eating

9High Consumption 
of Fruits, Vegetables, 
and Legumes
INTRODUCTION
Plant foods provide the foundation of all Mediterranean diets, and a wide variety 
of fruits, vegetables, and legumes, along with whole grains, makes up a significant 
part of this foundation. Research over the past several decades has shown numerous 
health benefits of fruit, vegetable, and legume intake in regard to managing weight 
and decreasing chronic disease risk, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular dis -
eases (CVDs), and diet-  related cancers. These benefits, however, are conferred only 
when total caloric intake equates with energy expenditure. Consuming too many 
calories from carbohydrate-  rich plant sources typically leads to increased fat stor -
age and insulin resistance. Fruit juices, for instance, are typically higher in sugar 
(from added sugars) and calories than a piece of fresh fruit and contain little or no 
intact fiber.
Fruits traditionally consumed in Mediterranean nations include fresh oranges and 
other citrus fruits, avocados, dates, grapes, and raisins. Many Mediterranean peo -
ple eat fruit for dessert. Some commonly eaten vegetables are tomatoes, eggplant, 
onions, squash, peppers, and dark greens, such as spinach.
Fruits, vegetables, and legumes are rich sources of antioxidant vitamins, most 
minerals, and other beneficial phytochemicals. These substances provide many 
potential health benefits, including helping to prevent oxidation of cholesterol in 
arteries, which may lower risk of CVDs. Many of these antioxidants are found in the 
pigments that give fruits and vegetables their specific colors. Fruits and vegetables 
with deeper colors generally indicate the presence of higher antioxidant levels, as 
in dark leafy greens, deep yellow and orange vegetables, berries, and citrus fruits. 
All fruits, vegetables, and legumes, however, contain unique properties that may 
be beneficial to health and can be part of a healthy diet. Table 9.1 lists the com -
mon fruits, vegetables, and legumes eaten in traditional Mediterranean diets and the 
major micronutrients and phytochemicals contained in each selected food.
Highlight: Fruits and vegetables with deeper colors generally indicate the pres -
ence of higher antioxidant levels.98 The Mediterranean Way of Eating

Most vegetables and legumes, as well as many fruits, have high water content, 
low energy density, and little or no fat. Avocado is an exception in that it is high 
in fat, although most of the fat is of the healthier monounsaturated type. Because 
of the high fat content, avocados are also high in calories. Portion size becomes an 
important consideration in consuming this nutritious fruit commonly found in many 
Mediterranean diets. Most fruits, vegetables, and legumes also have a low glycemic 
index (GI) and contain varying amounts of soluble and insoluble fiber. Strawberries, 
for example, contain more insoluble fiber in their tiny seeds, while the flesh of the 
berry provides more soluble fiber. Similarly, apple skins contain more insoluble fiber, 
and the flesh has more soluble fiber. All of these characteristics of fruits, vegetables, 
and legumes likely provide valuable benefits for health in addition to their many 
vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. Chapter 10, “High Consumption of Whole 
Grains,” provides more information about fiber.TABLE  9.1 (Continued)

than the peeled remainder.100 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
leguMes
A class of vegetables that include dried beans, peas, and lentils comprises the legume 
nutritious plant foods. Legumes have seed pods that split along both sides when ripe. 
The dried seeds of legumes are referred to as pulses. (Peanuts also are classified as 
legumes, but they are usually included with nuts.) Legumes are a staple food through -
out much of the world and hold a prominent place in the diets of Mediterranean 
nations. Legumes, such as fava beans (broad beans), black beans, white cannellini 
beans, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), green and red lentils, red kidney beans, and 
lima beans, commonly substitute for meats because they are inexpensive, filling, 
and readily available. Soybeans are used less often.
Legumes come packed with many valuable vitamins, minerals, and other phy -
tochemicals, making them a powerhouse of nutritional benefits. Legumes are low 
in fat, most of which is unsaturated, and they have no cholesterol. Legumes also 
contain more fiber, especially soluble fiber, than most fruits and vegetables. In addi -
tion, legumes  have a low glycemic index (GI), which may help in reducing the risk 
of type 2 diabetes. Because legumes fix nitrogen from the atmosphere in their root 
nodules, they are rich in reasonably high-  quality protein, unlike other fruits and veg -
etables. The proteins in legumes, however, have a low content of sulfur-  containing 
amino acids, making legumes partially incomplete sources of protein compared to 
protein found in animal products, such as meat, eggs, and dairy. Consuming legumes 
along with other plant foods that contain these missing amino acids, such as grains, 
nuts, or seeds, either in the same meal or at another meal during the day, will provide 
for the full range of essential amino acids needed by the human body.
Highlight:  Legumes come packed with many vitamins, minerals, and phyto -
chemicals, making them a powerhouse of nutritional benefits.
Soybeans  are a unique type of legume  in that they contain all the essential amino 
acids required for a complete protein. Soybeans rarely were consumed in traditional 
Mediterranean diets.  Many Asian populations , however , have consumed soybeans 
and soy-  derived foods for centuries. In Western nations, many soy foods are not 
made from whole soybeans as they are in Asian countries. Whole soy foods that have 
been minimally processed include soy nuts, tofu, edamame (young green soybeans), 
and miso (fermented soybeans). These soy foods are low in saturated fat and con -
tain vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and dietary fiber. Highly processed soy 
foods, such as soy bars, beverages, and burgers, often are high in added sugars and 
lack healthy ingredients such as phytochemicals and dietary fiber. Reviews of many 
research studies have not established clear-  cut benefits of consuming soy foods, but 
several reports suggest cardioprotective effects on blood lipids.
Whole soy foods, unlike highly processed soy foods, likely have overall health 
benefits because of their unique nutrient profile. In addition to having all the nutri -
tional attributes of other legumes and having high-  quality protein, soybeans contain 101 High Consumption of Fruits, Vegetables, and Legumes
isoflavones , a group of antioxidant polyphenols, also known as phytoestrogens, that 
also provide health benefits. Currently, insufficient evidence is available to support 
a beneficial role of isoflavones separate from the whole soybean. Replacing some 
higher-  calorie and higher-  fat meats and dairy foods with whole soy foods, however, 
may provide health benefits, including better weight management.
Highlight: Whole soy foods, unlike highly processed soy foods, likely have 
overall health benefits because of their unique nutrient profile.
Legumes of all types make hearty and nutritious soups (e.g., various bean and pea 
soups), casseroles (e.g., beans and rice), and stews (e.g., chili with or without meat). 
When added to greens and other raw vegetables, legumes can make a nutritious and 
satisfying salad. Legumes tend to be bland, so that when used alone, as in a side dish, 
seasonings such as garlic, vinegar, hot sauce, oregano, thyme, or other herbs and 
spices will heighten the taste.
APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON FRUITS, VEGETABLES, AND LEGUMES 
TO REDUCE RISK OF CHRONIC DISEASES
Eating fruits, vegetables, and legumes may help to prevent overweight and obesity, 
as well as contribute to losing unwanted weight. Eating more of these low-  energy- 
dense plant foods, especially vegetables and legumes, in place of high-  energy-  dense 
foods, such as full-  fat dairy products, high-  fat meats, and sweets, will lead to a lower 
caloric intake and have a beneficial effect on managing weight in a healthy way.
Fruits and vegetables also contain many micronutrients, some of which exhibit 
strong antioxidant effects that may play an important role in reducing type 2 dia -
betes risk. The relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and diabetes risk 
has been studied in both men and women. A recent study utilizing data from the 
Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) diet cohort found that consumption of green leafy veg -
etables and fruit was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. (The NHS is an 
observational study of 30,000 female U.S. nurses that has examined diet and other 
lifestyle variables in relation to chronic disease for over 30 years.) Consumption of 
fruit juices, however, appeared to have the opposite effect. Fruit juices do have some 
antioxidant activity, but they lack the intact fiber found in whole fruit and thus may 
be less filling and satisfying than eating the actual fruit. In addition, fruit juices 
with added sugars are high in calories that may contribute to weight gain by way of 
increased fat stores.
Berries, especially dark-  color berries such as strawberries and blueberries, are a 
good source of anthocyanins and other polyphenols, as well as micronutrients and 
fiber. In several studies, the greater total antioxidant capacity of these substances has 
been associated with improved cardiovascular risk profiles, including reductions in 
low- density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and dyslipidemia, along 102 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
with more efficient glucose metabolism. All fruits provide important health benefits, 
but berries in particular appear to have a significant impact on health, especially 
heart health.
A high intake of dark yellow/  orange and dark leafy green vegetables was found 
to help reduce risk of type 2 diabetes among overweight women enrolled in the 
Women’s Health Study (WHS), a National Institutes of Health (NIH) investigation 
with a few different treatment arms. Other studies also suggest a higher intake of 
fruits and vegetables (five or more servings per day), especially among women and 
overweight women, may be associated inversely with type 2 diabetes incidence.
One of the largest and longest studies of health and dietary habits of women and 
men was carried out as part of the NHS and the Health Professionals Follow-  Up 
Study. Findings from this study in 2004 indicated that the higher the average daily 
intake of fruits and vegetables, the lower the risk of developing CVD. Individuals 
who averaged eight or more daily servings were 30% less likely to have had a heart 
attack or stroke compared to individuals averaging less than one and one-  half serv -
ings per day. All fruits and vegetables likely contributed to this benefit. Significant 
contributions, however, were made by dark-  green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, 
Swiss chard, and mustard greens; cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels 
sprouts, kale, and cabbage; and citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruit.
Legumes contain potassium and magnesium, and they are a major source of 
folate, a B vitamin that may play a role in lowering heart disease risk. Researchers 
who reviewed health records of over 9,000 men and women from the first National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), along with follow-  up data, 
found that individuals who ate legumes four or more times per week had a 22% lower 
risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) than individuals who ate legumes 
fewer than one time a week. Substituting legumes in the diet for animal protein foods 
high in saturated fat and cholesterol may lower risk of type 2 diabetes and CVDs.
Highlight:  Substituting legumes in the diet for animal protein foods high in 
saturated fat and cholesterol may lower risk of type 2 diabetes and CVDs.
In a recent meta-  analysis of several large, long-  term U.S. and European cohort 
studies, researchers separately examined the data concerning fruit and vegetable 
consumption and their effects on stroke risk and then on CHD risk. A similar protec -
tive effect was found for fruit and vegetable consumption on both stroke and CHD. 
Results indicated that individuals consuming more than five daily servings of fruits 
and vegetables had approximately a 20% lower risk of stroke and CHD compared 
with individuals who consumed less than three daily servings.
Fruit and vegetable consumption also has been associated with a reduction 
in blood pressure, a major risk factor for CVD. The Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension (DASH)–style diet is high in fruit, vegetables, and legumes as well as 
in whole grains, nuts, and low-  fat dairy products. On the other hand, the DASH diet 
is low in red and processed meats, sweetened beverages, and sodium. Findings in the 103 High Consumption of Fruits, Vegetables, and Legumes
Normative Aging Study suggested that higher intakes of green leafy vegetables, as 
found in a Mediterranean-  style diet, may reduce the risk of CVD through beneficial 
changes in heart rate variability.
Highlight: Fruit and vegetable consumption also has been associated with a 
reduction in blood pressure, a major risk factor for CVD.
Some of the protection from type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic dis -
eases likely relates to the numerous vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals found in 
different fruits, vegetables, and legumes as well as in whole grains, nuts, and seeds. 
The complex array of nutrients and phytochemicals in these whole plant foods, how -
ever, makes it difficult to determine which specific nutrient or phytochemical exerts 
the major protective effect. Each fruit, vegetable, and legume provides a unique com -
bination of diverse nutrients and phytomolecules. The health benefits from consum -
ing whole plant foods likely result from both the “additive” and “synergistic” effects 
of these food components rather than from a single nutrient or phytochemical act -
ing alone.
Research findings also suggest that vitamins and minerals are more effective in 
food form than in supplement form. High levels of certain nutrients in a supplement 
can have serious consequences, including toxic effects resulting from overdose. For 
example, some research suggests that vitamin C supplements in people with diabetes 
may increase risk of heart disease in this population. Vitamin C from food, however, 
has not been found to pose a risk. In general, an overall dietary pattern that provides 
essential nutrients needed for good health, such as a Mediterranean-  style dietary pat -
tern, is highly preferable to a poor diet with supplements.
dArk- green leAfy veget Ables
A large variety of leafy greens is available, ranging from sweet and mild to sharply 
bitter—something for everyone. All leafy greens are highly nutritious and con -
tain ample amounts of vitamin A, in the form of β- carotene, and vitamin C. Many 
greens are also high in iron, folate, and fiber, while being low in sodium and calories. 
Greens can be cooked in a variety of ways, including boiling them gently in a small 
amount of water, steaming, sautéing, or stir-  frying in a little olive oil. Greens can be 
added to soups and stews, casseroles, legumes, rice, and pasta sauces to increase fla -
vor and nutrient content of these dishes. Many books on foods and cooking provide 
new and interesting ways to prepare less-  familiar vegetables, including greens (see 
Appendix C). Each recipe should be accompanied by a nutrition analysis that states 
serving size; the number of calories; amount and type of fat (i.e., total, saturated, 
trans, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated); sodium; carbohydrate (i.e., dietary fiber, 
sugars, other carbohydrates); protein; and other nutrients contained in that serving 
size. This information helps determine whether the particular recipe fits in your 104 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
dietary plan and whether you need to modify it slightly by selecting less salt or an 
alternative oil and less of it or adding fresh or dried herbs.
The following are brief descriptions of several types of greens:
• Beet greens  are mild, slightly sweet, and very tender, needing only minimal 
steaming. They are typically sold with their roots (beets) attached, which 
can be peeled and prepared in a variety of ways.
• Collard greens  are fairly mild but become sweeter after exposure to frost. 
The large, sturdy leaves require a longer cooking time than most other greens 
to become tender. Discard the tough stems or use in making soup stock.
• Kale , a member of the cabbage family, has a slight peppery flavor. The 
ruffled leaves add a slight crunchiness to its otherwise soft texture.
• Swiss chard , a member of the beet family, comes in two main varieties, red 
and green. Each has the same mild flavor and soft texture. Note that the red 
kind will impart a reddish color to any other food with which it is cooked.
• Rapini  (broccoli rabe) has a robust flavor and a nice varied texture. The 
tender but chewy leaves are complemented by crunchy flowerets.
• Mustard greens  have a sharp, peppery, and somewhat bitter taste. To reduce 
their strong flavor, try combining them with milder greens.
• Turnip greens  have a slightly sweet taste when young, but they may become 
bitter tasting as they age.
While these greens are best consumed after light cooking, many other kinds of 
nutritious greens can be eaten either raw or cooked, including spinach, escarole, aru -
gula, dandelion greens, Romaine lettuce, and purslane, a popular Mediterranean salad 
green rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Rinse all greens thoroughly in water before eating.
sAlAd dressings
Choose healthy salad dressings and limit the amount. Just 2 tablespoons may contain 
200 or more calories. Opt for lower-  calorie dressings containing 100 calories or less 
for 2 tablespoons. Healthier salad dressings also are low in saturated fat, contain no 
trans fat, and are low in sodium (i.e., 200 μg or less for 2 tablespoons). Alternatively, 
a simple dressing can be made by mixing together extra-  virgin olive oil and vinegar 
(regular or flavored) or lemon juice, along with a little minced garlic, pepper, or other 
seasonings, as desired.
potAtoes
Most types of potatoes are a good source of vitamin C, vitamin B6, and potassium. 
The potato skin provides fiber, and both the skin and flesh contain many valuable 
phytochemicals and trace elements, such as selenium, manganese, and chromium. 
Some studies have shown that chromium, in particular, may exert positive effects 
in blood sugar management. The white potato, often characterized as a “bad” car -
bohydrate (i.e., “white starch”) with a high GI value, warrants closer examination. 105 High Consumption of Fruits, Vegetables, and Legumes
GI values for potatoes can vary widely. Small red potatoes and small white pota -
toes (i.e., “new” potatoes) generally produce a lower glycemic response than higher- 
starch baking potatoes. Individuals trying to lose weight or manage or prevent type 2 
diabetes frequently are told to avoid potatoes because they trigger a sharp rise in 
blood sugar. Such a blood sugar response may be due in part to an oversize serving, 
especially in restaurants. In general, the larger the portion of a carbohydrate-  rich 
food, the greater the impact it has on blood sugar concentration.
Highlight: In general, the larger the portion of a carbohydrate-  rich food, the 
greater impact it has on blood sugar concentration.
A medium potato (150 g or around 5 ounces) contains approximately 110 Calories, 
0 g of fat, 23 g of carbohydrate, 3 g of protein, 10 mg of sodium, and more than 2 g of 
fiber. Calories can soar if potatoes are topped with lots of butter, full-  fat sour cream, 
full- fat cheese, bacon bits, or gravy. Just 1 tablespoon of regular butter doubles the 
calories in a medium-  size baked potato. Small amounts of healthier toppings include 
low- fat (or fat-  free) and low-  sodium sour cream, plain yogurt, or cottage cheese, as 
well as heart-  healthy margarines, chopped raw or cooked onions (in olive oil), left -
over cooked veggies, salsa, pepper, garlic, and dried or fresh herbs, such as chives, 
parsley, or dill.
sWeet potAtoes
Sweet potatoes are unique, containing many beneficial nutrients and phytochemicals. 
They have more fiber, especially soluble fiber, than regular potatoes and typically 
have a lower GI value. Sweet potatoes are also rich in carotenoids —the orange and 
yellow pigments that may play a role in helping the body use insulin more effectively. 
In addition, sweet potatoes contain a natural plant compound called chlorogenic 
acid, also found in coffee, which may help in reducing insulin resistance. Keep calo -
ries and blood glucose concentration low by avoiding, or strictly limiting, sweet top -
pings, such as maple syrup, brown sugar, or marshmallows. Opt for small amounts 
of other toppings, such as a heart-  healthy margarine and a sprinkle of cinnamon . 
This pleasant-  tasting spice has been shown in some studies to have a beneficial effect 
on blood sugar concentration. As always, because portion size is important, eat a 
smaller-  size potato or half of a large one.
cooking  tips
All fruits and vegetables, both raw and cooked, can be part of a healthy diet. Although 
some nutrients are lost during cooking, light cooking may help some vegetables, 
such as broccoli, be more easily digested. Minimal cooking may also make certain 
nutrients, such as beta-  carotene in carrots, more available for use by the body. On the 
other hand, raw carrots generally produce a lower glycemic response than do cooked 106 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
carrots. Of course, portion size also can affect the glycemic response. Both raw and 
cooked carrots can be nutritious choices. For example, one might have a handful of 
raw minicarrots for a snack or have cooked carrots as part of a meal containing other 
high-  fiber, low-  GI carbohydrates—along with a little healthy fat and protein—which 
help blunt the glycemic effect.
A little cooking goes a long way in making certain that vegetables retain most of 
their valuable nutrients. Water-  soluble vitamins, such as vitamin C and many B vita -
mins, can leach out of vegetables into the cooking water. Vegetables retain more 
nutrients when lightly steamed or microwaved compared to boiling in water. To 
reduce nutrient loss, use a small amount of water and boil gently until the vegetable 
is slightly crunchy, al dente. The leftover vegetable water can be frozen and used 
later to contribute nutrients to condensed soups, homemade soup stocks, and low-  fat 
sauces and gravies.
cost
Fruits and vegetables can be expensive, but the following list offers suggestions for 
keeping down costs:
• Use coupons when available and take advantage of store specials. However, 
if the produce on sale looks past its prime (i.e., has wilted, bruised, or dis -
colored leaves), it likely has lost some nutritional value, and thus it would be 
better to make a different choice.
• Choose nutritious frozen vegetables if fresh vegetables are past their prime. 
Frozen vegetables keep much longer than fresh, and there is less risk of 
waste. When possible, stock up on sales of frozen vegetables, but choose 
plain vegetables and avoid those with added salt or high-  fat sauces.
• Choose locally grown produce when available in stores or at farmers’ 
markets. In-  season produce is often cheaper and more environmentally 
friendly than produce shipped from a distance. Join together with others 
and buy in bulk.
• Look for nearby “pick-  your-  own” farms.
• Join a wholesale shopping club or warehouse store, such as Costco or Sam’s 
Club, that sells food in bulk at a discount price. Divide large purchases into 
smaller amounts and share with others.
• Canned vegetables and legumes are often less expensive than fresh pro -
duce. Choose those that are low in sodium or contain no sodium. If unable 
to find a low-  sodium product, rinse canned vegetables and legumes in a 
sieve or colander and heat gently in a small amount of fresh water.
• Add fresh or dried herbs and spices, garlic, onions, black pepper, lemon juice 
(great on broccoli), vinegar, or hot sauce to perk up the flavor of plain vegetables.
• Save any unused vegetable parts, such as celery leaves or broccoli stalks, 
and store in freezer bags to add when needed to soups, stews, or other dishes.
• Serve leftover cold cooked vegetables as a salad topped with a small amount 
of healthy dressing.107 High Consumption of Fruits, Vegetables, and Legumes
convenience
When convenience is a top priority, use packaged, prewashed greens and precut 
vegetables. Packaged vegetables cost more than vegetables you have to wash, cut up, 
and prepare, but when time is a factor in deciding whether to have vegetables with a 
meal, opt for convenience. Other ways usually can be found to offset the cost of the 
more expensive packaged vegetables, such as having smaller portions of meat or lim -
iting chips and other unhealthy snack foods. Microwavable plain frozen vegetables, 
including the “steam-  in- the- bag” type, can save time and cleanup. They also tend to 
be less expensive than packaged precut vegetables.
pesticides
Pesticide use on produce dissuades some people from incorporating these essential 
foods into their daily diet. It is important to remember, however, that pesticide resi -
dues on produce are usually found at very low levels and are well below the tested 
and documented safe levels of exposure for humans. The potential health benefits of 
eating fruits and vegetables, and other produce, far outweigh the risks from minute 
amounts of pesticide residue. Washing produce thoroughly with water, using a soft 
scrub brush, when appropriate, can remove surface residue. Also, different pesti -
cides are used on different fruits and vegetables. Eating a wide variety will reduce 
exposure to any one specific pesticide while maximizing exposure to the healthful 
benefits. Organic produce, although usually more expensive, is available for those 
who want to reduce further exposure to pesticide residue.
In recognition of ever-  increasing evidence for the many healthful benefits pro -
vided by a high dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC; http://www.cdc.gov); Produce for Better Health Foundation 
(PBH; http://www.pbhfoundation.org), and their national partners issued a new pub -
lic health initiative in 2007: Fruits & Veggies—More Matters ™. The 2010 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans (http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/  DietaryGuidelines.htm) pro -
vide the basis for this initiative, and MyPlate (http://www.choosemyplate.gov) car -
ries the messages of these guidelines.
The exact amount or number of servings of fruits, vegetables, and legumes needed 
for optimal risk reduction of various chronic diseases has not yet been determined. 
Ample servings, however, are recommended by most health organizations because 
of the multiple benefits to health provided by these plant foods. Recommendations 
for serving sizes and number of servings of fruits, vegetables, and legumes to con -
sume on a daily basis are listed in Table 9.2.
BOTTOM LINE
Numerous studies suggest a diet rich in a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and 
legumes, as in a Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern, provides many important 
health benefits. Substituting fruits, vegetables, and legumes for foods high in satu -
rated and trans fats, sodium, refined carbohydrates, and added sugars may help lower 108 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic diseases and may have a 
positive effect on weight management.
In general, the darker its color, the more nutrients the fruit or vegetable contains. 
Citrus fruits; dark yellow and orange vegetables (e.g., winter squash, pumpkin, and 
carrots); cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli and Brussels sprouts); and dark leafy 
greens (e.g., beet greens, mustard greens, collards, and kale) are especially nutri -
tious. Nevertheless, all fruits and vegetables, regardless of color, offer unique health 
benefits, as do the different types of legumes. Consumption of fruit juices, however, 
should be limited, as should sauces and other toppings high in fat, sodium, or sugar.TABLE  9.2

10High Consumption 
of Whole Grains
INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, whole grains, also referred to as cereal grains, are consumed in greater 
amounts than any other food group. Whole-  grain wheat flours have been used for 
centuries in traditional Mediterranean diets for making bread, pasta, and other 
flour-  based food items. The key to retaining the healthful benefits of dietary grains 
rests on using whole grains, or at least minimally processed ones, rather than highly 
refined grains and grain products. Whole grains contain protein, carbohydrate, and 
unsaturated fat, which provide major sources of energy. Whole grains also contain 
a storehouse of vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, and dietary fiber,  all of which 
contribute significantly to meet human nutritional needs  and support good health.
The cereal grain, or kernel, is made up of three parts: bran , endosperm , and germ . 
Figure 10.1 illustrates this structure of the wheat kernel. The outer layer of the ker -
nel, the bran portion, contains large amounts of fiber and most of the B vitamins and 
certain minerals, such as iron, zinc, and magnesium. The largest part of the kernel, 
the endosperm, contains mainly carbohydrate, in the form of starch, but also some 
protein and small amounts of B vitamins, certain minerals, and fiber. The germ, the 
heart of the kernel and its smallest portion, is rich in vitamin E and contains unsatu -
rated fatty acids along with small amounts of B vitamins and some minerals. Whole- 
grain food products retain all three parts of the kernel, as compared to most refined 
grains, which retain only the endosperm. Nutrients from the bran and germ also are 
used by the body to help metabolize the carbohydrate contained in the endosperm.
Whole grains, along with fruits, vegetables, and legumes, contain varying amounts 
of dietary fiber. Fiber comes only from plants and exists in two forms: soluble and 
insoluble. Plant foods contain both forms of fiber, with one or the other form pre -
dominating. As a rule, coarsely ground grains retain more fiber and have a lower 
glycemic index (GI) than finely ground grains. Most dietary fiber cannot be bro -
ken down by human digestive enzymes into units small enough to be absorbed. 
Therefore, plant fibers do not provide calories or contribute to weight gain. The fiber 
present in whole grains appears to exert a stronger protective effect in type 2 diabetes 
risk reduction than does fiber found in fruits and vegetables. The high water content 
of most fruits and vegetables contributes to their typically lower fiber content com -
pared to whole grains.
Highlight: Plant fibers do not provide calories or contribute to weight gain.110 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Oats, including oat flour, oatmeal, and oat bran, contain the highest proportion 
of soluble fiber of all the cereal grains. Significant amounts of soluble fiber are also 
present in barley and in the seeds of the psyllium plant. Whole wheat products, along 
with wheat germ and corn bran, are high in insoluble fiber. Both soluble and insol -
uble fibers provide many health benefits and may play a role, directly or indirectly, 
in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and other 
chronic diseases, as well as in weight management.
Strong associations exist between consumption of whole-  grain foods and other 
indicators of good health. Individuals who eat a lot of whole-  grain foods are likely to 
be leaner; eat less fat, especially saturated and trans fats; be more physically active; 
and tend to smoke less. A healthier overall lifestyle goes hand in hand with making 
healthier individual food choices, such as choosing whole grains rather than highly 
refined and processed grains. Many types of bread, rolls, muffins, and other bak -
ery products available in markets and restaurants are made from highly processed 
grains. Dietary intake of whole grains remains low in the United States, as well as 
in other populations—a factor that may play a part in the increasing worldwide inci -
dence of obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, CVDs, metabolic syndrome, and certain diet-  related cancers 
appear to have a common etiology characterized by insulin resistance. Excessive 
fat storage, glucose intolerance, and a high concentration of insulin in the blood are 
recognized hallmarks of insulin resistance (see Chapter 4). Study findings indicate 
that whole-  grain consumption may lower insulin resistance and improve glucose tol -
erance, thereby reducing the risks of several chronic diseases.

APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON WHOLE GRAINS TO REDUCE RISK 
OF OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES
The role played by whole-  grain foods in preventing the development of type 2 diabe -
tes may relate in large part to their effects on body mass index (BMI). Study results 
show a healthy association between a diet high in whole grains and a lower BMI, a 
smaller waist circumference, and reduced risk of being overweight. Men and women 
who consume more whole grains and dietary fiber as part of an overall healthy 
dietary pattern are less likely to gain weight or develop obesity over time. However, 
consumption of refined grains appears to promote weight gain over time, especially 
in women. Whole-  grain and dietary fiber consumption may aid in weight manage -
ment through enhanced and extended satiety and by slowing gastric emptying. These 
effects tend to delay the return of hunger, reduce the frequency and amount of food 
eaten during the day, and lower daily calorie intake.
Highlight: Study results show a healthy association between a diet high in whole 
grains and a lower BMI, a smaller waist circumference, and reduced risk of 
being overweight.
Earlier research suggested that the bran  part of grain has a greater effect in type 2 
diabetes risk reduction than does the germ  or endosperm . More recent evidence pres -
ents a stronger case for consuming the whole grain than for consuming bran alone. 
For example, adding isolated wheat bran to the diets of people with type 2 diabetes 
has not been shown to improve various indicators of blood sugar control, such as 
insulin resistance. Keeping the structure of the whole grain intact is associated with 
beneficial metabolic effects, including improvement in glycemic control.
Various types of studies have examined the relationship between whole-  grain 
intake and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Strong and consistent support for 
increasing whole-  grain consumption to prevent type 2 diabetes came from a number 
of prospective cohort studies. Epidemiological studies have shown an association 
with higher intakes of whole grains and a 20% to 30% reduced risk for type 2 diabe -
tes. Evidence from observational studies and clinical trials suggested that consuming 
whole grains might lower fasting insulin levels and decrease insulin resistance in 
individuals with or without diabetes, resulting in improved blood glucose control. 
Both men and women who incorporate whole grains into their daily diet have been 
shown to decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, consuming large 
amounts of high GI carbohydrates along with low intakes of high-  fiber whole-  grain 
cereals has been shown to increase type 2 diabetes risk.
Highlight: Both men and women who incorporate whole grains into their daily 
diet have been shown to decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes.112 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON WHOLE GRAINS TO REDUCE RISK 
OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND METABOLIC SYNDROME
Whole wheat products, wheat bran, and corn bran have high amounts of insoluble 
fiber. Even though insoluble fiber does not reduce blood low-  density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol concentration, results from studies suggest insoluble fiber might 
offer some heart protection by reducing blood pressure or reducing inflammation. A 
low dietary fiber intake is associated with a higher blood concentration of C-  reactive 
protein (CRP), a biomarker for inflammation that has been linked to CVD risk. Most 
plant foods, including whole grains, contain a mixture of both soluble and insolu -
ble fibers, with one or the other type of fiber predominating. For example, one-  half 
cup of some wheat bran cereals contains 9 g of insoluble fiber and 1 g of soluble 
fiber. Other whole-  grain foods may have equal amounts of both types of fiber. For 
example, a one-  half cup serving of old-  fashioned oatmeal typically contains 2 g of 
soluble fiber and 2 g of insoluble fiber. Thus, consuming fiber-  rich whole-  grain food 
products often provides benefits of both types of fiber and contributes to heart health 
as well as to overall health.
Highlight: Consuming fiber-  rich whole-  grain food products often provides ben -
efits of both types of fiber and contributes to heart health as well as to overall health.
Whole grains, such as bulgur, rolled oats, or brown rice, retain more fiber and 
have a lower GI than do finely ground grains. Regular white rice, sometimes referred 
to as polished rice, is not whole grain as the bran and germ have been removed. 
Wild rice comes from a different type of grass plant than regular rice, but it is whole 
grain and very nutritious. Whole grains also contain a wide variety of antioxidant 
compounds, including vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-  carotene, and other phytochemi -
cals. Oxidation of lipoproteins, such as LDL cholesterol, contributes to the pathogen -
esis of atherosclerotic CVD. Findings from several studies suggest that antioxidant 
intakes from dietary sources, particularly from whole-  grain food products, play a 
major role in helping to protect the heart from the deleterious effects of oxidation. 
Antioxidant supplements taken as pills, however, do not seem to provide similar 
heart-  protective effects and, in some cases, may even cause harm, especially at high 
doses. Phytochemicals, vitamins such as the B vitamins, minerals such as magne -
sium, and other nutritive and nonnutritive compounds in whole-  grain food products 
may offer additional heart-  protective benefits. See Table 10.1  for the major micro -
nutrients and phytochemicals contained in various grain and grain products con -
sumed in most traditional Mediterranean diets.
Scientific evidence for the heart-  healthy benefits of consuming whole grains and 
other plant foods with intact fiber continues to grow and strengthen. Results from 
some studies suggest that fiber intake from cereal grains, including whole grains and 
bran, is associated with lower risk of incident CVD—even more so than fiber intake 
from fruit and vegetables, especially in people over 65 years of age. Data from other 113 High Consumption of Whole Grains
studies indicate that people who eat whole grains have a lower risk of heart attack 
and high blood pressure, compared to those consuming refined grains. In a recent 
study, researchers found that men who had an average weekly consumption of two to 
six servings of whole-  grain cereal exhibited a significantly lower risk of heart failure 
than men who ate one serving of whole-  grain cereal less often than once a week. 
Findings from many studies in both men and women indicate that individuals with 
higher intakes of whole-  grain foods have lower risk of heart disease, heart attack, 
and stroke compared to individuals who eat little or no whole-  grain foods. In addi -
tion, a pooled analysis of numerous cohort studies showed an association between 
consumption of dietary fiber from cereal grains and fruits and a reduced risk of 
coronary heart disease (CHD).
Highlight: Studies indicate that people who eat whole grains have a lower risk of 
heart attack and high blood pressure compared to those consuming refined grains.
Participants in the previously mentioned studies consumed whole grains, espe -
cially wheat bran cereals with intact fiber, rather than added fiber extracted (isolated) 
from their plant source. In general, these fiber-  rich diets in study participants con -
tributed to reductions in intestinal absorption of cholesterol from animal foods, low -
ered serum total cholesterol concentration, and improved serum lipid profiles, all of 
which are associated with reduced risk of heart attacks and other heart conditions.
Whole-  grain intake also is inversely associated with metabolic syndrome and 
mortality from CVD in middle-  aged and older populations. On the other hand, con -
sumption of refined grains is associated positively with a higher prevalence of meta -
bolic syndrome.
Mechanisms by which whole grains protect the heart have yet to be fully under -
stood. Teasing out the single nutrients or other components in whole grains that TABLE  10.1

offer the most heart protection is extremely difficult. Most likely, the many health 
benefits result from the components of whole grains working together. Consuming 
only moderate amounts of whole grain and fiber, however, is unlikely to offset the 
negative effects of an otherwise-  poor diet. To help reduce risk of CVD and other 
chronic diseases, it is important not only to increase consumption of whole grains 
but also to increase consumption of other healthy high-  fiber foods in place of  less- 
healthful foods . Consuming a food solely because its product label states it contains 
some  whole grain or fiber is ignoring consideration of the whole product and the 
part it plays in an overall healthy dietary plan. So, it is critical to check the Nutrition 
Facts panel and the ingredients list on the label for specific items of concern, such 
as calories, types and amounts of fat, sugars, and sodium, contained in the stated 
serving size.

sumption of other healthy high-  fiber foods in place of  less healthful foods .
UNDERSTANDING IDENTIFICATION, PROCESSING, 
AND LABELING OF GRAINS
identific Ation of Whole- grAin food products
Trying to decide whether a food product is truly whole grain can be challenging. The 
color of bread, for example, may not necessarily be a clue as molasses or caramel 
coloring could have been added to make the bread appear to be darker whole-  grain 
bread. Products labeled as multigrain , stone ground , or 100% wheat tend not to 
be whole-  grain products. They may contain some whole grains or none at all. The 
number of grains, whether 7, 12, or even more, is irrelevant if the grains are not 
whole grains. To be a true whole-  grain food, the first item in the ingredient list on 
the package must use words such as 100% whole wheat or 100% whole- grain rye.  
Examples of whole grains and whole-  grain products, along with their characteristics, 
are listed in Table 10.2.
Highlight: To be a true whole-  grain food, the first item in the ingredient list on 
the package must use words such as 100% whole wheat or 100% whole- grain rye.
To make it easier to identify whole-  grain products, the Whole Grains Council, a 
group of manufacturers, scientists, and chefs, created two stamps for use on qualify -
ing products (Figure 10.2). Each stamp states the amounts of whole grains in grams 
(g) contained in a serving of the product carrying the stamp. Underneath each stamp 
is the message: “Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily.” This amount of whole 
grains is found in the three 1-ounce servings recommended for adults on a daily 115 High Consumption of Whole Grains
TABLE  10.2
Examples of Whole Grains and Whole-  Grain Products and Their Characteristics
Grains Characteristics
Barley Rich in protein, B vitamins, and fiber.
Brown rice 
and wild 
riceThe entire grain with only the outer husk removed. White rice is not whole grain as the 
husk, bran, and germ have been removed. Long- grain rice, white or brown, has a lower 
GI than medium- or short- grain (sticky) rice. Parboiled or converted white rice has been 
pressure steamed and dried before milling, which infuses some of the nutrients from the 
bran and germ layer into the inner part of the kernel. Wild rice comes from a different 
grass plant than regular rice and is whole grain.
Buckwheat A fruit of the Fagopyrum  genus and a member of the rhubarb family. It is high in B vitamins 
and protein. Buckwheat groats are the hulled, crushed kernels; when roasted, they are 
called kasha.
Bulgur Wheat berries that have been steamed, dried, and crushed into fine, medium, or coarse 
grinds.
Couscous A type of pasta made of crushed and steamed durum wheat semolina.
Cracked 
wheatDried, uncooked whole wheat berries that have been cracked open by milling into fine, 
medium, or coarse fragments.
Flaxseed A rich source of omega-3 fatty acids; use ground seeds to reap this important benefit.
High- fiber 
cerealsWhole grain or bran cereals as well as steel- cut or old- fashioned oatmeal. Quick- cooking 
oatmeal has a slightly higher GI but retains most of the nutrients and fiber of regular 
oatmeal. Flavored instant oatmeal packets, however, usually contain a lot of added sugar.
Kamut A wheat relatively high in protein content.
Millet A cereal grass with many varieties, most of which are high in protein, B vitamins, and 
certain minerals, such as iron and phosphorus.
Oats High in vitamin B1 with good amounts of vitamin B2, vitamin E, and soluble fiber.
Orzo A tiny, rice- shaped pasta (durum wheat semolina) that makes a good substitute for rice.
Pastas Durum wheat semolina pastas (made from coarsely milled cracked wheat rather than 
finely ground wheat flour) have large particles that take longer for digestive enzymes to 
break down.
Quinoa Commonly considered a grain, quinoa (kin- wa) is actually the seed of a plant 
(Chenopodium quinoa ) and is related to leafy green vegetables such as spinach and 
Swiss chard. Quinoa contains more protein than any other grain and is considered a 
complete protein as it contains all the essential amino acids. It also is gluten free and 
can be used in most any way rice is used. The leaves of the quinoa plant are also edible.
Rye Rye contains the highest lysine content of all the grains. (Lysine is an amino acid used in 
creating body proteins.)
Spelt An ancient cereal grain with a nutlike flavor that is a cousin to wheat.
Teff An ancient North African cereal grass and the world’s smallest grain. It is higher in 
protein than wheat and has a high concentration of nutrients, including calcium and 
iron. It has a mild nutty flavor and is naturally gluten free.
Whole- 
grain 
breadsThe coarser the bread, the better. Look for visible grains or seeds or for breads labeled 
100% whole grain. Flatbreads typically are made with whole- grain flours and are 
unleavened (i.e., made without yeast). Sourdough bread contains a special type of yeast 
that produces acids that can moderate blood sugar. Pita bread, a round- pocket yeast 
bread, may or may not be made with whole wheat flour.116 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
basis. The 100% Stamp® on a food product indicates it contains all its grain ingredi -
ents as whole grains, and has at least 16 g (a full serving) of whole grain per labeled 
serving. The product bearing the 100% Stamp on the above example contains 18 g 
of whole grain per serving.
The Basic Stamp® on a food product indicates it contains at least 8 g (a half 
serving) of whole grain, but it also may contain some refined grain. Even if a product 
contains large amounts of whole grain, as in the above example (20 g) it must use 
the Basic Stamp if it also contains additional isolated grain ingredients such as extra 
bran or germ, or refined flour .
the Milling  process
Enrichment of Flour
In milling whole grains to produce flour, the bran and the germ are usually removed, 
leaving only the endosperm. Milling results in the reduction or loss of many impor -
tant micronutrients. A few select micronutrients, such as iron and some B vitamins, 
are added back after processing in amounts similar to those lost to “enrich” the flour. 
Other micronutrients, however, as well as most of the fiber, remain lost. The first 
item under the ingredients listed on highly processed breads and other grain product 
labels is commonly “enriched flour” rather than whole-  grain flour. If the grain has 
been ground, cracked, or flaked, it has to retain nearly the same proportions of bran, 
endosperm, and germ present in the original grain to be called a whole grain. Whole- 
grain breads of all kinds generally have a more dense texture than milled breads due 
to their high intact dietary fiber content. Since whole-  grain flour products retain all 
the parts of the kernel, they provide a more nutritious product than highly processed 
grain products.

Grain Stamps are a trademark of Oldways Preservation Trust and the Whole Grains Council,

Highlight: Since whole-  grain flour products retain all the parts of the kernel, 
they provide a more nutritious product than highly processed grain products.
Fortification of Flour
Flour also may be “fortified,” in which case extra nutrients have been added that 
were not present before processing. An example would be “calcium-  fortified flour.” 
In general, fortification provides nutrients that may not be present in sufficient 
amounts in many diets. In some cases, one or more nutrients originally present in 
a food have been increased when added back. Since 1998, all enriched cereal grain 
product flour has been fortified with folic acid (see Chapter 7). In addition, isolated 
fiber may be added voluntarily to some highly refined products, but it may not pro -
vide the same benefits as intact dietary fiber. Many ready-  to- eat cereals are highly 
fortified with a variety of vitamins, minerals, and other substances. It is important 
to look at the serving size on a box of cereal (or on any other food container for that 
matter) and then to check the Nutrition Facts panel to see the nutrients contained in 
that serving. If more than one serving of a highly fortified cereal is consumed daily, 
or if other highly fortified foods are also consumed, it is possible to ingest more of a 
nutrient than recommended. Consuming a vitamin, mineral, or other nutrient beyond 
the tolerable upper level (UL) may pose serious health risks.
sodiu M
Bread and other bread products as well as some ready-  to- eat cereals are one of the 
most common food sources of sodium, partly due to the large amount that is typi -
cally added to these foods and consumed in the United States on a daily basis. The 
amount of sodium in a slice of bread can vary greatly depending on the brand, as 
well as the size and thickness of the slice. Read the Nutrition Facts panel on food 
labels for the serving size and number of milligrams (mg) of sodium contained in a 
serving of a particular product.
The terms sodium  and salt are often used interchangeably as most of the sodium 
we consume is in the form of salt. Table salt, actually sodium chloride (NaCl), is 
composed of 40% sodium and 60% chloride. Numerous studies provided strong 
evidence that a high-  salt intake contributes to high blood pressure, which in turn 
increases risk of stroke and CVD.
Recommendations for sodium intake differ slightly among various U.S. and 
international health organizations. A general agreement exists, however, that sodium 
intake in the United States as well as worldwide is excessive, and reducing salt intake 
is likely to provide significant health benefits. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
recommend a sodium intake of less than 2,300 mg per day for most healthy indi -
viduals. For some individuals, including those with diabetes, high blood pressure, or 
chronic kidney disease, the recommendation decreases to no more than 1,500 mg of 
sodium per day. Little evidence supports further reduction of sodium intake to less 
than 1,500 mg/  day.118 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
gluten  intoler Ance And celiAc diseAse
Gluten is a protein found in certain grains and grain products, including wheat, bar -
ley, and rye. Individuals of any age can become sensitive to gluten and develop celiac 
disease (also called celiac sprue and gluten-  sensitive enteropathy). In this condition, 
the body’s immune system attacks the gluten in foods and damages the small intes -
tine. The ongoing damage results in chronic inflammation, and the body loses its 
ability to absorb nutrients efficiently from food. Symptoms of celiac disease vary 
widely, from mild to severe, and can include abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss, 
and diarrhea. Following a lifelong gluten-  free diet is the only treatment. Fortunately, 
the number and variety of gluten-  free foods on the market has been increasing dra -
matically. However, this does not mean all gluten-  free foods are healthy. It remains 
important to consider the whole food and its other ingredients to see how it fits with 
a healthy overall dietary plan. Some gluten-  free foods are made with refined grains 
and not enriched or fortified with important vitamins and minerals. These foods may 
also be high in fat and sugar and low in fiber. For individuals who do not have celiac 
disease, there is typically little benefit to eating a gluten-  free diet.
A healthy gluten-  free diet can easily fit in with a Mediterranean-  style dietary 
pattern. There are many good substitutes for wheat and other grains containing glu -
ten, including rice and corn. Of course, all the fruits, vegetables, legumes, meats, 
fish, many dairy products, and nuts and seeds are gluten free. Table 10.3 lists some 
gluten-  containing and gluten-  free foods and food ingredients. Many U.S. and foreign

The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that at least half of all 
grains consumed be whole grains. The dietary guidelines also suggest that consum -
ing at least three servings (three 1-ounce equivalents) of whole grains daily may 
reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and CHD, as well as help with weight management. 
Table 10.4 lists the recommended number of servings and serving sizes of grains and 
whole grains to consume per day.
BOTTOM LINE
Grains, and grain-  based foods, especially whole grains, and other plant foods pro -
vide the foundation on which to build a healthful, well-  balanced diet, such as a 
Mediterranean-  style diet. Evidence continues to accumulate supporting the positive 
influence of whole-  grain intake on achieving and maintaining a healthy weight and 
helping to prevent type 2 diabetes. Consuming more high-  fiber, whole-  grain food 
products, such as 100% whole-  grain cereals and breads, in place of low-  fiber, refined- 
grain products, also may help to reduce risk of CVDs, metabolic syndrome, and other 
chronic diseases. A gluten-  free diet can be incorporated easily in a Mediterranean 
way of eating. Aim for a daily intake of a variety of minimally processed grains high 
in both soluble and insoluble fibers.TABLE  10.4

11Moderate Consumption 
of Nuts and Seeds
INTRODUCTION
Most Mediterranean populations consume nuts such as almonds, pine nuts (pignolia), 
pistachios, hazelnuts, and walnuts. Sesame seeds also figure prominently in the diets 
of most Mediterranean nations. Other seeds frequently consumed include fennel, 
caraway, celery, poppy, and flax. Pumpkin and sunflower seeds also offer unique 
health benefits, but they have only been eaten since discovery of the New World, as 
they are native to the Americas. Substituting moderate amounts of some nuts and 
seeds for other, less-  healthy foods likely plays a role in helping to prevent chronic 
diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
The Mediterranean Diet Pyramid includes nuts and seeds in the large plant food 
group; MyPlate includes nuts and seeds in the meat and beans group. Nutrient-  dense 
nuts and seeds have good amounts of plant protein and are rich in dietary fiber. Nuts 
and seeds also contain many important minerals (e.g., copper, magnesium, potas -
sium, and zinc), vitamins (e.g., folate, niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin E), along with 
a variety of beneficial phytochemicals. Vitamin E (tocopherol) acts as an antioxi -
dant in addition to performing other significant functions in the body. Almonds have 
higher amounts of calcium and dietary fiber than most other nuts; pistachios are one 
of the richest nut sources of potassium. Walnuts have one of the highest and most 
potent antioxidant contents of any tree nut. Hazelnuts contain the greatest amount 
of folate as well as the highest amount of proanthocyanin (a polyphenol) of any tree 
nut. See Table 11.1 for the major micronutrients and phytochemicals contained in 
some nuts and seeds commonly consumed in most traditional Mediterranean diets.
Nuts and seeds, while being nutrient dense , are also energy dense  and contain 
high amounts of calories and fat. Most of the fat, however, is the healthier unsatu -
rated type rather than saturated fat. Walnuts and flaxseeds contain high amounts 
of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFAs), mainly in the form of alpha lino -
lenic acid (ALA), while almonds, hazelnuts (filberts), and pistachios contain high 
amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids (MFAs). Pignolia (pine nuts) contain PFAs 
with a good ratio of omega-3 to omega-6. The majority of fat in sesame seeds comes 
from fairly equal amounts of PFAs and MFAs. Nuts and seeds are the source of 
many culinary oils, including sunflower seed, flaxseed, walnut, and canola oil, devel -
oped through plant breeding. Canola oil contains good amounts of both MFAs and 
omega-3 PFAs. Canola is an abbreviated name for Canadian oil, low acid.
The energy provided in a 1-ounce serving of nuts ranges between 160 and 200 
Calories, depending on the particular nut. The calories in a 1-ounce serving of seeds 122 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
are similar to those in nuts but are more often in the lower end of this calorie range.  
One tablespoon of nut butter has approximately 90 calories.
APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON NUTS AND SEEDS 
TO REDUCE RISK OF CHRONIC DISEASES
Concern regarding possible weight gain for consumers of high-  calorie nuts and seeds 
often is expressed. Several studies, however, have found little evidence to justify this 
concern. Findings from a recent prospective cohort study of more than 8,000 men 
and women revealed that participants who ate nuts two or more times a week had a 
significantly lower risk of gaining weight than did those who never or almost never 
ate nuts. Similar results were found in a randomized controlled trial comparing two 
low- calorie diets for weight loss in overweight adults: a Mediterranean-  style diet 
rich in nuts (35% fat) and a standard low-  fat diet (20% fat). After 18 months, the 
Mediterranean-  style, moderate-  fat diet group had a decrease in both body weight 
and waist circumference. The low-  fat diet group, however, progressively regained 
body weight. In addition, the Mediterranean-  style diet group had greater long-  term 
participation and adherence than the low-  fat diet group, making the former an attrac -
tive dietary option for weight management. A recent meta-  analysis of randomized 
clinical trials of nut intake showed that diets enriched with nuts did not increase 
body weight, body mass index (BMI), or waist circumference compared with control TABLE  11.1

diets. Strong evidence also suggests that people who include nuts in their diet typi -
cally have a lower BMI and a decreased tendency toward gaining weight compared 
to people who rarely or never eat nuts.
Highlight: Strong evidence also suggests that people who include nuts in their 
diet often have a lower body mass index (BMI) and a decreased tendency toward 
gaining weight compared to people who rarely or never eat nuts.
Various hypotheses offer explanations for the apparent contradiction between 
consumption of high-  fat, high-  calorie nuts and the tendency not to gain weight or 
even to lose weight. One hypothesis suggests that the energy from nuts, mainly fat 
calories, is not fully absorbed, resulting in higher excretion of fat in stools than typi -
cally would be expected. A lower level of fat absorption might be related to the par -
ticular type of lipid-  storing granule in nuts or possibly to effects produced by various 
components in nut fiber. Consumption of nuts also may have an effect on satiety. The 
combination of higher content of fat, dietary fiber, and protein may increase one’s 
feeling of fullness and lead to less-  frequent eating and reduction in daily overall food 
and energy intake.
A number of studies have examined the relationship between nut consumption 
and risk of type 2 diabetes. One large study found that women who consumed five or 
more 1-ounce servings of nuts per week had a 27% lower risk of developing type 2 
diabetes than did women who never ate nuts. Similar results were found for those 
consuming equivalent amounts of peanut butter. Results from two large cohort stud -
ies, the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and NHS II, suggested that higher walnut con -
sumption was associated with a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes in women. 
Several other large studies also found a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes in 
those who regularly consumed nuts. Evidence continues to accumulate that eating a 
moderate amount of nuts, approximately 1 ounce, on most days of the week may help 
reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Highlight: Evidence continues to accumulate that eating a moderate amount of 
nuts, approximately 1 ounce, on most days of the week may help reduce the risk 
of type 2 diabetes.
Inflammation  has been identified as a factor implicated in insulin resistance, obe -
sity, type 2 diabetes, and CVDs. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers, especially 
C- reactive protein (CRP), are considered to be strong independent risk factors for 
type 2 diabetes. Frequent nut consumption has been associated with lower levels of 
these inflammatory markers. Most plant foods, including nuts and seeds, contain 
high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants, and other nutrients that may 
play a role in reducing inflammation and help to explain, in part, the inverse associa -
tion of nut consumption with the risk of type 2 diabetes.124 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Findings from numerous epidemiologic studies show an association between con -
sumption of nuts and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). An early study, 
the Adventist Health Study, found that individuals consuming nuts more than four 
times a week had a substantially lower risk of dying from a heart attack compared to 
individuals who ate nuts less than once a week. A later study found a similar benefit 
in postmenopausal women who had approximately two or more 1-ounce servings 
of nuts a week. These women were less likely to die of CHD than were similar 
women who ate less than one serving of nuts a month. Additional studies continue 
to find favorable effects of nuts on risk of heart disease. In the NHS, women who 
ate 1 ounce of nuts five or more times a week had much lower risk of nonfatal heart 
attacks and fatal CHD than did women who never ate nuts or ate nuts less than once 
a month. Findings from the Physicians Health Study indicated an inverse association 
between nut consumption and total CHD death in men, mainly due to a reduced risk 
of sudden cardiac death. A pooled analysis of 25 intervention trials found that eating 
nuts improved blood lipid levels in a dose-  related manner. Different types of nuts had 
similar effects and were greatest among those men and women with high baseline 
low- density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and those consuming Western diets.
Highlight: The Adventist Health Study found that individuals consuming nuts 
more than four times a week had a substantially lower risk of dying from a heart 
attack compared to individuals who ate nuts less than once a week.
Since the early 1990s, over two dozen prospective studies have shown that diets 
containing nuts, nut oils, or nut butters have favorable effects on heart disease risk. 
The healthful benefits of nut consumption seem to apply to all groups of people that 
researchers have studied, including males and females, different racial groups, and 
adults of all ages.
Results from a recent study found that patients with the metabolic syndrome  saw 
significant improvements in the syndrome after a year of following a Mediterranean- 
style diet enriched with nuts. This diet proved better than that for a control group coun -
seled on a low-  fat diet and better than that for a group who followed a Mediterranean 
diet with extra olive oil.
PEANUTS
Peanuts, also known as groundnuts, are technically a legume, but they share many 
similarities in nutrient composition with tree nuts. Frequent consumption of peanuts, 
like tree nuts, in moderate  amounts may help reduce type 2 diabetes risk and heart 
disease risk as well as the rate of weight gain. Peanuts are a good source of both 
MFAs and protein. They also contain antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, includ -
ing good amounts of niacin (vitamin B3), folate, copper, and manganese. One note of 
caution: Peanuts, as well as some other nuts, commonly are associated with allergic 
reactions and need to be avoided in susceptible individuals. Both children and adults 
can be affected.125 Moderate Consumption of Nuts and Seeds
NUT BUTTERS
Peanuts and some other nuts, such as almonds, also are available as nut butters, 
which likely have similar healthy nutritional profiles as the nuts themselves. When 
purchasing nut butters, check the ingredients list on the container and opt for those 
products that list only peanuts, or other nut, as the sole ingredient. Avoid products 
that contain hydrogenated oil (a source of saturated fat) or partially hydrogenated 
oil (a source of trans fat). Choose nut butters that contain little or no added salt 
(listed as “sodium” in the Nutrition Facts panel). Organic and natural nut butters are 
good options. Some stores carry nuts in bulk, as well as the equipment in which to 
grind and make fresh nut butters. A food processor also can be used to grind nuts at 
home. Keep containers of most nut butters refrigerated, once opened, as their high- 
fat content causes them to become rancid over time.
Highlight: Peanuts and some other nuts, such as almonds, also are available as nut 
butters, which likely have similar healthy nutritional profiles as the nuts themselves.
In general, regular nut butters tend to be a better choice than lower-  fat versions, as 
the majority of the fat already is the healthier unsaturated kind of fat. In addition, lower-  
fat nut butters typically have twice as much carbohydrate as the regular nut butters. In 
natural  nut butters, the oil separates and rises to the top of the container, compared to 
more highly processed kinds, in which the oil already is incorporated into the ground 
nuts. Do not pour off oil that has accumulated at the top, or the nut butter will be stiff 
and hard to spread. To simplify the oil mixing-  in process of natural nut butters, keep 
two containers on hand, one for current use and the other turned upside down in the 
cupboard for future use. The oil in the container stored upside down will gradually 
move toward the top over time and mostly incorporate itself into the whole product, thus 
requiring less effort to mix in what little oil remains when ready to use. After opening, 
keep refrigerated, and the oil will not tend to separate out again. Most nut butters tend 
to become more firm when nearing the bottom of the container, but placing the open 
container of nut butter in the microwave for a few seconds usually makes the nut but -
ter easier to spread. Make sure the nut butter container is appropriate for microwaving.
QUALIFIED HEART HEALTH CLAIM FOR NUTS
In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a qualified heart health 
claim for seven kinds of nuts. Scientific evidence suggests that eating a moderate 
amount (1.5 ounces per day) of most nuts as part of a diet low in saturated fat and 
cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease. The seven kinds of nuts approved 
for this claim are almonds; hazelnuts (filberts); peanuts; pecans; some pine nuts, such 
as pignolia (pignoli); pistachios; and walnuts. Other kinds of nuts were not included 
in this claim because they contain higher amounts of saturated fat. Some seeds, such 
as sunflower and sesame, also likely would help reduce the risk of heart disease, but 
a health claim request for them has not yet been submitted or approved.126 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Highlight: Eating a moderate amount (1.5 ounces per day) of most nuts as part 
of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease.
SEEDS
Few data exist on seed consumption in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes, CVD, or 
other chronic diseases, as compared to existing data on nut consumption. Similar 
health benefits, however, are assumed as the nutrient composition of seeds is com -
parable to that of nuts. Sesame seeds contain high amounts of both MFAs and PFAs 
and contain a good amount of dietary fiber. They also are a good source of copper, 
manganese, magnesium, calcium, iron, phosphorus, vitamin B1 (thiamin), and zinc. 
Unhulled sesame seeds have a greater amount of calcium than hulled sesame seeds, 
but the calcium is in the form of calcium oxalate and is not as easily absorbed as the 
calcium in the hulled form. Both unhulled and hulled sesame seeds contain about 
the same amount of protein. A 1-ounce serving provides approximately 5 to 6 g 
of protein.
HYPOTHESES FOR THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF NUTS AND SEEDS 
IN REDUCING CVD RISK
Several hypotheses have been suggested to help explain the heart-  healthy effects 
of most nuts and seeds. Since individuals with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk for 
heart disease than those individuals without diabetes, these mechanisms pertain to 
a large population.
• Fatty acid profile —high in unsaturated fatty acids and low in saturated 
fatty acids, which may help reduce the body’s total cholesterol blood con -
centration as well as the LDL fraction of cholesterol.
• Fiber —rich in both soluble and insoluble fiber molecules, which may aid in 
lowering blood pressure and reducing inflammation.
• Plant protein —high in arginine, an amino acid, which aids in the body’s 
synthesis of nitric oxide and causes blood vessels to dilate, resulting in low -
ering of blood pressure. This in turn may help counteract the stiffness of 
arteries clogged with cholesterol from animal foods and possibly reduce 
further artery clogging.
• Minerals —high in potassium, calcium, and magnesium and naturally low 
in sodium, which helps to protect against high blood pressure and offers 
many other health benefits.
• Vitamins —rich in antioxidants, especially vitamin E, and rich in folate, a 
B vitamin that may help protect against heart disease and stroke.
• Phytochemicals —rich in phytosterols and phenolic acid compounds, which 
may help counter atherosclerosis (i.e., the accumulation of fatty deposits in 
blood vessels).127 Moderate Consumption of Nuts and Seeds
RECOMMENDED NUMBER OF SERVINGS AND SERVING SIZES 
FOR NUTS AND SEEDS
The number of nuts and seeds in a serving can vary depending on their actual size. A 
serving generally is considered to be approximately ¼ cup (~1 ounce) nuts or approx -
imately 2 tablespoons seeds (~0.5 ounce). Because of their protein content, nuts and 
seeds may be substituted for foods in the meat and legume group. According to 
various food guides, 0.5 ounce shelled nuts (approximately the following: 7 wal -
nut halves, 11 whole almonds, 9 whole hazelnuts, 14 peanuts, or 23 pistachio nuts), 
1 tablespoon peanut butter, or 0.5 ounce seeds can be considered equivalent to a 
1-ounce serving from the meat and legume group. Table 11.2 lists the recommended 
number of servings and serving sizes for various nuts and seeds.
BOTTOM LINE
Groundnuts, tree nuts, and seeds have many health benefits to offer as they contain 
important micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and other phytochemicals. 
They also contain high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, protein, and fiber. A 
dietary pattern, such as a Mediterranean-  style diet, that includes regular consump -
tion of most nuts in moderate amounts consistently is associated with favorable TABLE  11.2

health outcomes, including lower levels of inflammatory markers. Nut consumption, 
in particular, may help lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes and CVDs.
Even though nuts are high in calories, considerable evidence suggests that moder -
ate consumption of these plant foods is not associated with weight gain if substituted  
for other less-  healthy foods, such as refined grain products or processed meats. 
Choose nuts and seeds without added sodium (i.e., salt) or at least ones that are low 
in sodium. Also, opt for natural nut butters without hydrogenated or partially hydro -
genated oils.129
12Moderate Consumption 
of Fish and Seafood
INTRODUCTION
Fish and seafood have long been a major source of protein for Mediterranean people, 
especially in the coastal regions. Because of the proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, 
as well as other large waterways, these nutritious fruits of the sea are usually con -
sumed fresh—within 24 hours of being caught. Fish not only provide high-  quality 
protein but also contain several essential minerals and vitamins, especially niacin 
(vitamin B3), B12, and B6. “Fatty” cold-  water fish, such as salmon, sardine, herring, 
albacore tuna, mackerel, and trout, are an excellent source of vitamins A and D, and 
they contain high amounts of healthful omega-3 fatty acids. Saltwater fish contain 
several important minerals, including iron, phosphorus, selenium, and iodine. The 
soft, edible bones of canned bone-  in fish, mainly salmon and sardine, provide a 
rich source of calcium.
Highlight: “Fatty” cold-  water fish, such as salmon, sardine, herring, albacore 
tuna, mackerel, and trout, are an excellent source of vitamins A and D, and they 
contain high amounts of healthful omega-3 fatty acids.
Fish and other seafood have additional benefits; they are low in total fat, saturated 
fat, and cholesterol. Shellfish, especially shrimp, are an exception in that they are 
moderately high in cholesterol but have low amounts of total fat and saturated fat. 
Dietary cholesterol, however, tends to have less of an influence on blood cholesterol 
concentration than does saturated fat and trans fat. Therefore, if not deep fried or 
dipped in copious amounts of drawn butter, moderate consumption of shellfish can 
still be part of a healthy diet.
Shellfish consumption, however, may have adverse health effects, especially if 
eaten too frequently, eaten raw, or ingested in large amounts at certain times of the 
year because of bacterial or viral contamination. An investigation into the associa -
tion between fish and seafood consumption and onset of type 2 diabetes found an 
increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in participants eating shellfish once or 
more a week. Whether other potential contaminants eaten along with the shellfish 
or the way in which the shellfish was prepared contributed to type 2 diabetes risk is 
unclear. On the other hand, results from another report showed that total, white, and 
fatty fish intake appeared to be beneficial for reducing risk of type 2 diabetes.130 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON FISH TO REDUCE RISK 
OF CHRONIC DISEASES
In numerous studies, consumption of fish and other seafood has been shown to con -
fer significant cardioprotective benefits. Few studies, however, have examined poten -
tial benefits of fish consumption and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. One study 
of older men and women (ages 64 to 87) with normal blood glucose levels found 
that those who usually ate fish (mean daily intake of 24.2 g or slightly less than 
1 ounce) had a significantly lower incidence of glucose intolerance than those who 
never ate fish. This result suggests that eating a small amount of fish on a regular 
basis (i.e., approximately 6 to 8 ounces a week) may contribute to a reduced risk of 
developing impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.
An ecological study involving 41 countries on five continents examined fish/ 
seafood consumption, obesity, and risk of type 2 diabetes in two different age 
groups: 22- to 44-year-  old men and women and 45- to 64-year-  old men and women. 
Positive association was found in both age groups between obesity and type 2 dia -
betes (well documented in many studies), as well as an interaction effect identified 
among all three factors: obesity, type 2 diabetes, and total fish/  seafood consumption. 
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes rose significantly with obesity in countries with 
low fish/  seafood intake, whereas the prevalence of type 2 diabetes decreased sig -
nificantly with obesity in countries with a high fish/  seafood intake. These findings 
indicate that a moderate or high intake of fish/  seafood may help reduce the risk of 
type 2 diabetes even in obese populations. In individuals who already have type 2 
diabetes, a few studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids may improve the blood 
lipid profile as well as lower insulin resistance. It should be recalled that plant-  based 
alpha-  linolenic acid (ALA) found in foods such as flaxseed and walnuts may also 
moderately lower risk of type 2 diabetes.
Fish consumption provides an array of cardiac benefits, including an association 
with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and sudden cardiac death, espe -
cially in high-  risk groups. The most significant cardiovascular benefits have been 
associated with two omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and doco -
sahexaenoic acid (DHA), both of which are found in fatty fish. Scientific evidence 
suggests that consuming these omega-3 fatty acids reduces blood triglyceride con -
centration. Triglycerides are considered an independent risk factor for heart disease, 
and in type 2 diabetes, triglyceride levels are frequently elevated. Thus, consuming 
fish, especially fatty fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, may confer significant health 
benefits in people at high risk for type 2 diabetes.
Highlight: Scientific evidence suggests that consuming these omega-3 fatty 
acids reduces blood triglyceride concentration. Triglycerides are considered an 
independent risk factor for heart disease, and in type 2 diabetes, triglyceride 
levels are frequently elevated.131 Moderate Consumption of Fish and Seafood
Results from a meta-  analysis of studies on fish consumption and CHD mortality 
indicated a dose-  response effect. Either low (one serving/  week) or moderate (two to 
four servings/  week) fish consumption showed a significantly beneficial effect on the 
prevention of CHD mortality. Findings from a review of studies, including clinical tri -
als and randomized controlled trials, indicated that marine omega-3 fatty acid intake 
was helpful in preventing cardiovascular events, especially in individuals at high risk 
for heart disease. Other reviews and studies also reported that diets high in fish and 
omega-3 long-  chain fatty acids were associated with decreased cardiovascular risk in 
type 2 diabetes. The risk reduction in these studies was thought to occur by inhibiting 
platelet aggregation, improving lipid profiles, and reducing cardiovascular mortality.
Data on fish intake and risk of incident heart failure were analyzed in over 84,000 
women ages 50 to 79 years of diverse ethnicity and background who were part of the 
baseline Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study cohort. Findings indicated a 
lower incident heart failure risk in women consuming five or more or more servings a 
week of baked/  broiled fish. In contrast, consumption of one or more servings a week 
of fried fish was associated with an increased risk of heart failure in women. Results 
from a Harvard study investigating the intake of fish and cardiovascular risk showed 
a modest consumption of fish (one to two servings a week), especially of fish high in 
omega-3 fatty acids, reduced risk of coronary death by 36% and total mortality by 17%.
Epidemiologic data, including multiple prospective cohort studies, indicate that 
consumption of approximately 7 to 11 ounces of fish per week might lead to lower risk 
of CHD. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends consuming omega-3 
fatty acids in foods for prevention of cardiovascular events, especially CHD. Other 
health organizations make similar recommendations. A recent analysis of pooled 
data from three large controlled trials showed significant reduction in cardiovascular 
events and provided strong evidence for cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty 
acids. Suggested beneficial health effects of omega-3 fatty acids from fish intake, 
in addition to a lowering of blood triglyceride concentration, include a decrease 
in the risk of heart arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death, decrease in 
blood pressure, and decrease in the growth rate of atherosclerotic plaque. The anti- 
inflammatory actions of omega-3 fatty acids also may contribute many additional 
cardiovascular benefits, as well as other health benefits.
Highlight: The anti-  inflammatory actions of omega-3 fatty acids also may con -
tribute many additional cardiovascular benefits, as well as other health benefits.
Omega-3 fatty acids also have been shown in a number of studies to improve lipid 
and other abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome.  Incorporating these fatty acids, 
especially from fatty fish, in the diets of individuals with this syndrome is likely to 
be beneficial when accompanied by other lifestyle modifications. Foods enriched 
with EPA and DHA may be another way to provide the healthful benefits of these 
fatty acids to individuals with metabolic syndrome.132 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
CONTAMINANTS IN FISH
Mercury and other contaminants present in fish have been an issue of concern for 
many years. Nearly all fish, both wild and farmed, contain some contaminants, but 
it is mainly the amount of contaminants certain types of fish contain that are of 
greatest concern. Higher mercury levels, for example, generally are found in larger 
carnivorous fish because of the prey they consume in the food chain. Mercury, a 
neuro  toxin, adversely affects brain development in fetuses and young children. 
Women who are pregnant, or who may become pregnant, and young children are 
advised to avoid consumption of shark, tilefish, swordfish, and king mackerel, all of 
which have high mercury levels. Farmed fish commonly contain the same nutrients, 
including omega-3 fatty acids, as wild fish, but while they may have lower amounts 
of mercury, they often have higher amounts of other contaminants, such as poly -
chlorinated biphenyls.
Both wild and farmed fish, however, are excellent sources of protein and other 
important micronutrients as well as being low in saturated fat. The health benefits of 
fish intake have been shown to exceed the potential risk of contaminants. For women 
of childbearing age, the benefits of moderate fish consumption, with the exception of 
the species mentioned, also outweigh the risks. To maximize the many valuable 
health benefits of consuming fish while minimizing any contaminants, adults should 
consume a variety of fish, including fatty fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, in moder -
ate portions, at least twice a week.
SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 
OF CONSUMING FISH
Some fish populations have been depleted, mainly due to overfishing and to meet 
high consumer demand. As a result, fish farming on a large scale has increased 
dramatically over the past several decades. The method of catching some fish, espe -
cially tuna, also has an environmental impact. In general, troll-  caught, pole-  caught, 
or pole-  and- line-  caught tuna is preferable to tuna caught with other methods because 
little or no wasteful by-  catch of other fish occurs when using these methods. Another 
advantage is that the fish caught by these methods are usually younger and smaller 
and thus contain less mercury.
Regional information on seafood quality concerning environmental issues can be 
found at Seafood WATCH (http://www.seafoodwatch.org), a website of the Monterey 
Bay Aquarium. A pocket seafood guide can be downloaded, printed, and easily car -
ried as a handy reference when shopping for fish. This site also offers a download -
able app for various mobile devices. When purchasing fish, consumers should look 
for the Marine Stewardship Council label (http://www.msc.org) or the Friend of the 
Sea label (http://www.friendofthesea.org). These labels certify that the fish have 
come from sustainable and well-  managed fisheries.
A consortium of food technologists and seafood specialists developed the 
Seafood Health Facts website (http://www.seafoodhealthfacts.org) to provide educa -
tion to consumers and health practitioners about the health benefits of seafood and 
to encourage seafood consumption. The information is well organized into several 133 Moderate Consumption of Fish and Seafood
main topics, including those relating to seafood choices, safety, nutrition, and ben -
efits versus risks. Most of the information, which includes many practical tips, can 
be easily printed or downloaded for convenient reference.
COOKING FISH
Fish and seafood in traditional Mediterranean diets were rarely, if ever, breaded 
and deep fried or served with a large amount of sauce high in calories, saturated 
fat, and sodium, as they often are in the United States. To retain the many healthful 
benefits of fish consumption, choose fish that are baked, broiled, grilled, or lightly 
sautéed in a little oil, such as olive oil or canola oil, and use only a small amount of a 
desired topping. Cooked fish, both hot and cold, make tasty and nutritious additions 
to soups, stews, salads, pastas, and sandwiches.
HEALTHFUL OPTIONS FOR FRESH FISH
Canned fish low in sodium can be a good choice and often provides a less-  expensive 
alternative to fresh fish. White albacore tuna has the highest amounts of omega-3 
fatty acids of the tuna species; tuna labeled “light” or “chunk light” is mainly 
skipjack or yellowfin tuna, which has less of these fatty acids. Canned tuna comes 
in either water or oil; the oil solubilizes some of the fish oil, and therefore when 
drained, the fish contains less of these healthy omega-3s than drained water-  packed 
tuna. Water-  packed tuna also has fewer calories. Vacuum-  sealed tuna in a pouch is 
another good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Salmon, even canned, has more omega-3 
fatty acids than tuna. Mackerel, a different species than king mackerel, also has high 
levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Fish and seafood labeled “frozen at sea” (FAS) provide 
another high-  quality choice as fish is now typically pulled from the water, filleted, 
and frozen within a few hours.
FISH OIL FROM FOOD AND SUPPLEMENTS
While offering some benefits, supplements do not contain many of the other impor -
tant nutrients present in fish. The protective effects of fish consumption most likely 
result from a combination of omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients, as well as from 
a “substitution effect” (i.e., the fish is used in place of red meat or other foods higher 
in cholesterol and saturated fatty acids or trans-  fatty acids). Vegetarians, or other 
individuals, who do not consume fish may benefit from using vegetable oils rich 
in omega-3 fatty acids, such as flaxseed, walnut, and canola oil. These oils, how -
ever, contain only alpha-  linolenic omega-3 fatty acids rather than the more effective 
omega-3 EPA and DHA. Algal (algae) oil provides DHA but little EPA, and it is 
available as a commercial supplement.
The approximate amounts of EPA and DHA contained in various fish and a few 
other foods are listed in Table 12.1. All types of salmon, especially sockeye salmon, 
are rich in EPA and DHA, much of which is found in the gray tissue under the skin. 
Individuals without heart disease may be advised to consume 400 to 500 mg/  day of 
EPA and DHA together, preferably from fish or other foods rich in omega-3 fatty 134 The Mediterranean Way of Eating

acids. This amount can typically be obtained from consuming approximately 3.5 
to 4 ounces of fatty fish twice a week. Individuals who already have heart disease 
may need 1,000 mg/  day of these two omega-3 fatty acids combined. Because this 
dose typically is higher than most individuals can obtain from food, consultation 
with a physician may be advisable to ensure the appropriate amount of supplemental

RECOMMENDED SERVINGS AND SERVING SIZES 
OF FISH AND SEAFOOD
The Mediterranean Diet Pyramid and the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 
along with several other health organizations, including the AHA and the Academy 
of Nutrition and Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association), continue 
to emphasize the importance of consuming two or more servings a week of a vari -
ety of fish and seafood. Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate icon, similar to USDA’s 
MyPlate icon but with added text, emphasizes choosing healthy protein from sources 
such as fish while limiting red meat consumption and avoiding processed meat. See 
Table 12.2 for recommended number of servings and serving sizes for fish.
BOTTOM LINE
Considerable scientific evidence supports the important health benefits of consum -
ing fish and other seafood. These foods are high in protein but low in saturated fat 
and contain a number of essential vitamins and minerals. Fatty fish (i.e., salmon, TABLE  12.2

which provide significant cardioprotective benefits. Fish consumption may also 
play a role in reducing risk of type 2 diabetes and some other chronic diseases. A 
food-  based approach to increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake is usually preferable 
to supplements.
To maximize the health benefits of fish consumption while minimizing exposure 
to potential contaminants, the intake of at least two servings per week from a variety 
of fish, including fatty fish, prepared in a healthful way is generally recommended.137
13Low Consumption 
of Meats and Low-  to- 
Moderate Consumption 
of Poultry and Eggs
INTRODUCTION
Meats, poultry, and eggs were consumed in limited quantities in traditional 
Mediterranean dietary patterns. These animal foods are important sources of high- 
quality protein, and they contain many essential vitamins and minerals. Certain 
kinds of these foods, however, contain relatively high amounts of cholesterol, satu -
rated fats, and other substances that may adversely affect health.
The plant-  based Mediterranean dietary pattern provides a healthy balance of ani -
mal and plant proteins, unlike many Western-  style diets. In the United States, for 
example, the typical diet includes high, and in some cases excessive, meat consump -
tion. In traditional Mediterranean diets, the meat portions were modest. Meats also 
were used in mixed dishes in small amounts with grains, vegetables, or legumes to 
provide additional high-  quality protein as well as a few essential water-  soluble vita -
mins and select minerals, especially iron and zinc. Animal protein primarily was 
derived from goats, sheep, and wild game, but now poultry and some red meats are 
eaten with more regularity in the Mediterranean diets. Pork was rarely consumed 
in traditional Mediterranean diets. Some religions also prohibit the consumption 
of pork.
Vegetarian diets typically have lower intakes of saturated fat and little or no cho -
lesterol or animal protein compared to omnivore diets. The lower rate of obesity 
among vegetarians is partly attributed to these dietary benefits. Considerable evi -
dence exists that plant-  based diets result in lower risks of heart disease and other 
chronic diseases. In the Adventist Health Study 2, findings indicated a significant 
association between vegetarian diets and lower all-  cause mortality. Some reductions 
in cause-  specific mortality were also found, including cardiovascular mortality.
While containing most of the nutrients needed for good health, vegetarian diets 
may be low in vitamin B12, which is found only in animal foods. Thus, some form of 
supplemental vitamin B12 may be warranted for vegetarians who strictly limit their 
consumption of animal foods. Iron, an important mineral, especially for growing 
children and women of childbearing age, may also come up short in vegetarian diets. 
Iron comes in two forms: heme iron  and non-  heme iron . Heme iron is found only in 138 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
animal products, and the human body uses it more efficiently than non-  heme iron, 
which is found mostly in plant foods. However, consuming a food high in vitamin C, 
such as citrus fruits or tomatoes, along with a vegetable containing non-heme iron, 
such as spinach, will enable the non-  heme iron to be utilized better by the body. In 
addition, many breakfast cereals and other plant food products are fortified with iron 
or vitamin B12. Check the Nutrition Facts panel on food labels for amounts of these 
nutrients contained in one serving.
Highlight: Vegetarian diets typically have lower intakes of saturated fat and lit -
tle or no cholesterol or animal protein, as compared to omnivore diets. The lower 
rate of obesity among vegetarians is partly attributed to these dietary benefits.
APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON MEATS TO REDUCE RISK 
OF CHRONIC DISEASES
The term meat  refers to the edible flesh of mammals (i.e., basically red meat), as 
opposed to the flesh of poultry and fish. Red meats include beef, veal, lamb, and 
pork, even though pork is typically advertised as “the other white meat.” A number 
of studies have examined the relationship between meat intake and risk of type 2 
diabetes, but data are limited and not always consistent. One study found that meat 
consumption in adults without type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
was associated positively with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, both risk fac -
tors for type 2 diabetes. Total meat intake in one cross-  sectional study with a high 
proportion of vegetarians found that meat consumption was associated with risk of 
type 2 diabetes, and that the association was strongest in males. Results from another 
study showed a lower prevalence of self-  reported type 2 diabetes in both men and 
women who followed a vegetarian diet as compared to those following a diet that 
included meat.
Findings from two studies revealed an association between red meat consumption 
and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes among middle-  aged and older women. Several 
other studies also have shown an association between processed meats, such as many 
types of lunch meat, hot dogs, bacon, and sausage, and a higher risk of type 2 dia -
betes, independent of other type 2 diabetes risk factors. Another study in men found 
that frequent consumption of processed meat, but not red meat, was associated with 
an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Other research findings suggest that a higher 
intake of total unprocessed meat may be linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabe -
tes, especially in obese women. An updated meta-  analysis of red meat consumption 
and risk of type 2 diabetes was carried out in three cohorts of U.S. men and women. 
Results suggested that red meat consumption, especially processed red meat, was 
associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The consumption of red meats 
or processed meats may not directly influence the likelihood of type 2 diabetes, but 
the major determinant of type 2 diabetes may instead be the overall dietary pattern 
consumed in Western nations, especially the United States.139 Consumption of Meats, Poultry, and Eggs
Highlight: The consumption of red meats or processed meats may not directly 
influence the likelihood of type 2 diabetes, but the major determinant of type 2 
diabetes may instead be the overall dietary pattern consumed in Western nations, 
especially the United States.
A relationship between a Western dietary pattern and increased blood sugar levels 
or elevated blood insulin levels has been shown in several studies. Two large prospec -
tive studies, the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) (women) and the Health Professionals 
Follow-  Up Study (men), identified two primary dietary patterns followed by the par -
ticipants: the “prudent” pattern and the “Western” pattern. The prudent diet contained 
higher intakes of fruit, vegetables, legumes, fish, poultry, and whole grains, while the 
Western diet contained higher intakes of red and processed meats, French fries, 
refined grains, sweets, and desserts. Results from both studies indicated that fol -
lowing a prudent dietary pattern was associated with significantly lowered risk of 
coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes. Further analysis of women in the 
Nurses’ Health Study also revealed that greater adherence to the prudent dietary pat -
tern was associated with lower risks of all-  cause and CVD mortality. Greater adher -
ence to the Western dietary pattern, however, increased these risks among women 
who were healthy at the beginning of the study. In a study of over 3,000 women, 
researchers also found an association between the Western-  style diet and deteriorat -
ing kidney function.
Researchers investigated the relation between red meat consumption and 
type 2 diabetes risk using data from three large cohorts of U.S. adults, the Health 
Professionals Follow-  Up Study, and the Nurses’ Health Study I and II, plus an updated 
meta-  analysis. Results suggested that red meat consumption, especially processed 
red meat, was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Substituting other 
foods, such as nuts, low-  fat dairy, or whole grains, for one serving per day of red 
meat was associated with a 16% to 35% lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Similar results 
were found in women, all participants in the Nurses’ Health Study I, in respect to 
replacing just one serving of red meat a day with poultry, fish, or nuts, and reducing 
risk of CHD.
Highlight: Substituting one serving per day of nuts, low-  fat dairy, or whole 
grains for one serving per day of red meat was also associated with a 16% to 
35% lower risk of type 2 diabetes.
Findings from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study suggest that con -
sumption of a Western dietary pattern promotes incidence of metabolic syndrome , 
as do individual food groups such as meat and fried foods. Dairy consumption, how -
ever, appeared to provide some protection against metabolic syndrome. Increased 
red meat consumption in yet another study was associated with increased risk of 140 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
metabolic syndrome and inflammation, as evidenced by higher blood concentrations 
of C-  reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of inflammation.
Highlight: Increased red meat consumption in yet another study was associated with 
increased risk of metabolic syndrome and inflammation, as evidenced by higher 
blood concentrations of C-  reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker of inflammation.
Studies also have looked at consumption of red meat in relation to mortality. 
Results from a large prospective study of over half a million men and women found 
that those individuals who had the highest intake of red and processed meats, com -
pared to those who had the lowest intake, had a modestly increased risk of death 
from all causes and from CVD and cancer. Conversely, in men and women who had 
the highest white meat (i.e., poultry and fish) intake, there was an inverse association 
for total mortality and cancer mortality, as well as all other deaths. In the European 
Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) and Nutrition, a positive association 
was found between processed meat consumption and higher all-  cause mortality, 
in particular due to CVDs and cancer. Results from two prospective cohort stud -
ies found that substituting other healthy protein sources, such as fish, poultry, nuts, 
legumes, low-  fat dairy, and whole grains, for red meat was associated with a lower 
mortality risk. Vegetarian dietary patterns also are associated with lower all-  cause 
mortality and with some reductions in cause-  specific mortality. These associations 
appeared to be more robust in men.
Red meat consumption has been shown in some studies to raise the risk of stroke. 
A meta-  analysis of prospective studies indicated that intake of fresh red meat and 
processed red meat as well as total red meat intake was associated with increased 
risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke. The association between red meat consump -
tion and stroke incidence was examined in the Swedish Mammography Cohort. Over 
34,000 women were followed for approximately 10 years, and the findings suggested 
that total red meat and processed meat consumption was associated with a signifi -
cant increased risk of cerebral infarction. Swedish researchers following more than 
40,000 men for 10 years found that men who reported consuming the most processed 
meats a day, but not fresh red meat, had a higher risk of stroke than those who con -
sumed the least.
ISSUES RELATED TO MEAT CONSUMPTION
The amount and frequency  of red meat and processed meat consumption most likely 
play a major role in diabetes risk as well as risk of obesity and certain other chronic 
diseases. In the Western dietary pattern, portion sizes tend to be large, and meat is 
frequently consumed with most meals. Today, restaurant servings of meat may be as 
much as 8 or 12 ounces or more. Becoming accustomed to large portions of meat, 
as well as to large portions of other high-  calorie foods, has skewed our understand -
ing of appropriate serving sizes. Typically, a serving is considered to be approxi -
mately 3 ounces of cooked meat (4 ounces raw meat). If you eat a larger portion 141 Consumption of Meats, Poultry, and Eggs
than one serving, then the amounts of calories, fats, sodium, and other nutrients also 
increase proportionally.
Preservatives and additives  in fresh (raw) and processed meats may have nega -
tive effects on health. Antibiotics have been used in animal feed for decades to treat 
sick animals and to prevent disease in healthy animals. In addition, antibiotics have 
increasingly been used as growth-  promoting agents. Large industrial farms often 
crowd many animals together, enabling disease to spread more easily among the 
animals. Over time, drug-  resistant bacteria can develop in animals given antibiotics; 
these bacteria then can spread to humans through food, the environment, or by direct 
human-  to- animal contact. Antibiotic-  resistant bacteria in humans are a major health 
concern as infections from these bacteria are becoming more difficult and expensive 
to treat.
Various additives to processed meats, such as nitrates and nitrites, may play a 
role in type 2 diabetes risk, CVD risk, and risk of several types of cancer. Phosphate 
additives in processed and plastic-  wrapped meats and meat products may also have 
adverse health effects. Some meat labels list the specific additives contained in 
the meat, while other labels use vague terms such as “enhanced,” “cured,” or “added 
solution.” Most processed meats are high in sodium, a risk factor for high blood 
pressure and heart disease. Look for labels on meats that say “additive free.” The 
term natural  stamped on meat products has little meaning and is loosely regulated. 
This term refers only to what happens after an animal is slaughtered, such as mini -
mal processing and no addition of artificial ingredients. The term naturally raised  
is more tightly regulated and refers to animals that have not been fed animal by- 
products or antibiotics or injected with added hormones. The term organic  means 
that meat and dairy animals were not given antibiotics or added hormones or fed 
genetically engineered crops.
Cooking  meats in certain ways may be detrimental to health. For example, hetero -
cyclic amines (HCAs), carcinogenic compounds formed when meats and poultry are 
cooked at high temperatures, have been postulated to exert toxic effects on pancre -
atic beta cells and may be related to certain types of cancer in people. Grilling and 
barbecuing generate the most heat and produce the highest HCA content. Pan frying 
and broiling produce the next-  highest HCA content. As the surface temperature of 
meat and poultry increases, the moisture content decreases, which leads to increas -
ing heterocyclic amines being produced. Flipping meat or poultry frequently while 
cooking reduces the surface temperature, and marinating these foods before cooking 
to retain moisture helps to reduce the amount of HCAs produced.
Meat  labeling carries a variety of nutrition terms. The term lean refers to any cut 
of meat with less than 10 g total fat, 4.5 g or less saturated fat, and less than 95 mg 
cholesterol per 100-g (3.5-ounce) serving. Extra lean  must have less than 5 g total 
fat, less than 2 g saturated fat, and less than 95 mg cholesterol per 3.5-ounce serv -
ing. Meat is sold by weight, and leaner cuts generally provide more meat for your 
dollar as there is less fat to cook away. Lean cuts of meat include eye-  of- round, pork 
tenderloin, and bison.
New federal labeling rules took effect in late 2013 that update a law known as 
Country-of-Origin labeling. Meat packers are now required to list where livestock 
was born, raised, and slaughtered. These rules were instituted to help strengthen 142 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
food safety and raise transparency about where meat is coming from. This informa -
tion is crucial in regard to any outbreak of food-borne illness.
Ground meats have a different labeling system based on percentages. In 2012, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) ruled that, effective that year, new nutri -
tion labels must be available for all ground meats and ground poultry. In addition, 
40 of the most popular cuts of fresh whole meat and poultry must either carry this 
information on individual packages or on charts posted near the point of sale. For 
example, if the product shows the percentage of lean meat, it must also show the 
percentage of fat. For example, a label stating it is 80% lean must also state it is 
20% fat. Fat contains 9 Calories per gram versus 4 calories per gram of protein, so 
that 20% fat amounts to a much greater percentage of Calories than does the protein 
in a portion of fresh ground meat. The Nutrition Facts panel on packages of meat 
will also show the number of Calories and the grams of total fat and saturated fat. 
To reduce intake of Calories and saturated fat, select ground meat with the highest 
available percentage of lean, which in turn will lower the percentage of fat. If using a 
higher-  fat ground meat, pour off all the fat after cooking and pat the meat with paper 
towels to absorb the remaining fat. Keep the drained fat in a covered container in 
the refrigerator and, when full, discard with the other garbage rather than pouring it 
down a sink drain, which eventually would create a stopped-  up drain.
Beef from pasture-  raised (grass-  fed) cows is somewhat lower in Calories and con -
tains slightly more omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins A and E, as well 
as beta-  carotene, compared to beef from feedlot (grain-  fed) cows. Grass-  fed beef, 
however, is more expensive. Consumers may choose grass-  fed beef over feedlot beef 
for a variety of reasons, including ethical issues, ecological concerns, or to support 
local businesses.
APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON POULTRY AND EGGS 
TO REDUCE RISK OF CHRONIC DISEASES
White meats, such as chicken, turkey, and other poultry, and some wild game birds 
typically have less saturated fat than red meats. White breast meat from poultry is 
lower in cholesterol and saturated fat than darker meat found in the thigh and other 
parts of poultry. Poultry can be cooked with or without the skin, but removing skin 
before eating will reduce the amount of saturated fat ingested. Ground chicken and 
turkey can be healthy substitutes for higher-  fat ground meats, but the package should 
state “white breast meat” and “contains no skin.” The meat from game birds is typi -
cally very lean; however, duck and goose meat are much higher in fat, especially 
when raised for food consumption, such as those used in pâté de foie gras. Replacing 
some red and processed meats with poultry and fish, as well as with plant protein, 
likely would provide multiple health benefits.
Little evidence exists for a direct link between poultry intake and type 2 diabetes 
risk or of interactions between poultry intake and body mass index (BMI) and type 2 
diabetes risk. Results from one large study in women indicated a modest decrease in 
risk of type 2 diabetes associated with poultry consumption, whereas no association, 
either positive or negative, was found in several other studies.143 Consumption of Meats, Poultry, and Eggs
Highlight: Little evidence exists for a direct link between poultry intake and 
type 2 diabetes risk or of interactions between poultry intake and body mass 
index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes risk.
Limited data also exist for an association between poultry consumption and CVD 
risk. Nevertheless, consuming almost any type of poultry, such as chicken and tur -
key, has few or no adverse effects on health as has been observed for some types of 
meat. Some findings suggest that CHD risk in women may be reduced by replacing 
one serving of red meat a day with poultry, fish, or nuts.
Highlight: Consuming almost any type of poultry, such as chicken and turkey, has 
few or no adverse effects on health, as has been observed for some types of meat.
Avoid, or limit, poultry as well as many pork products if the label says “seasoned” 
or “enhanced” with up to 15% (or higher) chicken broth or “solution.” This wording 
indicates added salt, usually a lot. Besides being less healthy than most products 
that do not use these salty solutions, you end up paying more money as the water 
(solution) weight is included in the total price of the product.
In most Mediterranean diets, eggs are consumed in moderation. Eggs are used 
often in baking, but they are consumed less frequently by themselves. Egg whites, 
compared to egg yolks, contain most of the protein and have more magnesium, ribo -
flavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), sodium, and potassium. Egg yolks, on the 
other hand, contain all the fat and cholesterol but also have more vitamins and min -
erals than the egg white, including all the fat-  soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), and 
most of the B vitamins, including thiamin (vitamin B1), B6, B12, folate, and biotin. 
Egg yolks also contain small amounts of iron, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, 
and manganese, as well as choline and carotenoids, mainly lutein and zeaxanthin. A 
whole large egg contains approximately 5 g of total fat, 1.5 g of saturated fat, no trans 
fat, and 6 g of protein. The protein in eggs is especially beneficial for individuals who 
consume little or no other animal protein. Older adults tend to have lower intakes of 
protein and, as such, may also benefit from consuming some eggs in their diet.
Contrary to popular opinion, brown eggs are not more nutritious than white eggs. 
Brown eggs have the same proportion of white and yolk and the same nutrients as 
white eggs. Brown eggs just come from a different breed of hen.
Different types of pasteurized cholesterol-  free and fat-  free egg white products are 
available and can be used to increase the amount of eggs consumed without overdo -
ing saturated fat and cholesterol. For example, rather than an omelet typically made 
from three whole eggs, one whole egg could be used along with two egg whites or 
the equivalent from an egg-  substitute product.
Eggs, especially egg whites, are a common food allergy in children. Most chil -
dren, however, outgrow egg allergies by their middle teens. Some individuals, how -
ever, continue to have egg allergies throughout adulthood.144 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
To reduce the risk of salmonella, keep eggs refrigerated in their original carton 
and avoid consuming raw or undercooked eggs, either by themselves or in dishes that 
contain eggs. Rinse eggs well under running water before cracking open.
Few studies have examined an association between egg consumption and risk of 
type 2 diabetes. One study analyzed data from two  large prospective cohorts, the 
Physicians’ Health Study I and the Women’s Health Study (WHS). Results suggested 
that consumption of seven or more eggs per week was associated with an increased 
risk of type 2 diabetes in women and men. Eating one egg a week, however, showed 
no increased risk. Individuals who have a high egg intake and eat other foods high 
in fat and cholesterol may have an even greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, 
CVDs, and other chronic diseases. In individuals who already have type 1 or type 
2 diabetes, it is possible that dietary cholesterol has a more negative effect than in 
those individuals without either type of diabetes.
Highlight: In individuals who already have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, it is pos -
sible that dietary cholesterol has a more negative effect than in those individuals 
without either type of diabetes.
Egg consumption in relation to an association with CVD has been a controver -
sial subject for many years. The controversy focuses mainly on the high cholesterol 
level of eggs. Dietary cholesterol, however, appears to have a much lower impact 
(by 2 to 1) on blood cholesterol concentrations and CVDs than does saturated fat 
and trans fat, at least in healthy adults at low risk for certain chronic diseases. In 
addition, results from a 2010 USDA study found that cholesterol levels in eggs had 
decreased since the last study in 2002. The current amount of cholesterol in a large 
egg is approximately 185 mg compared to the earlier finding of 213 mg per large egg.
Highlight: Dietary cholesterol … appears to have a much lower impact (by 2 
to 1) on blood cholesterol concentrations and CVDs than does saturated fat and 
trans fat, at least in healthy adults at low risk for certain chronic diseases.
Findings from two prospective studies, the Health Professionals Follow-  Up Study 
and the Nurses’ Health Study, suggested that consumption of up to one egg per day 
was unlikely to have a significant impact on CHD risk or stroke among healthy men 
and women. In a subgroup analysis, however, greater egg consumption appeared to 
be linked to a high risk of CVD among participants with diabetes. In a more recent 
prospective cohort study of participants from the Physicians’ Health Study 1, results 
indicated that having less than one egg per day did not increase risk of CVD in men. 
Egg consumption, however, was associated with mortality, and the association was 
stronger in participants with diabetes in a dose-  response manner.145 Consumption of Meats, Poultry, and Eggs
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NUMBER OF SERVINGS 
AND SERVING SIZES OF MEAT, POULTRY, AND EGGS
Recommendations about egg consumption vary, but based on limited availability of 
scientific findings, eating up to four whole eggs a week likely will not increase type 2 
diabetes risk. For individuals with established diabetes, the risk of CHD associ -
ated with higher egg consumption is slightly increased. These individuals may need 
to consider eating fewer than four whole eggs per week until new studies indicate 
other  wise. Consumption of up to one egg per day has not been found to have a major 
impact on risk of CHD or stroke among healthy men and women. The American 
Heart Association (AHA) allows for the consumption of up to one egg per day for 
healthy adults, while still considering the total daily cholesterol intake: 300 mg/ 
day cholesterol for healthy adults and 200 mg/  day for adults with, or at high risk 
for, heart disease. The lower cholesterol content of modern eggs makes it somewhat 
easier to stay within these suggested guidelines.
The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggest a daily intake from the meat 
and beans group of 5.5 ounce equivalents for a 2,000-Calorie diet, while the AHA 
recommends 6 ounces or less of lean meats, poultry, or seafood (Table 13.1). One 
serving generally is considered to be 1 ounce of lean meat, poultry, or fish or one egg. 
A 4-ounce portion of raw meat is equivalent to approximately 3 ounces of cooked 
meat. Amounts of legumes and of nuts and seeds used as meat substitutes were dis -
cussed in Chapters 9 and 11, respectively. Recommended number of servings and 
serving sizes for fish and seafood are located in Chapter 12.
BOTTOM LINE
Choose lean meat, poultry, or fish and limit servings to 6 ounces a day or less for a 
2,000-Calorie diet. Consuming less red and processed meat, and substituting poul -
try, fish, and plant proteins, may help indirectly to reduce risk of developing type 2

diabetes, CVDs, certain cancers, and other chronic diseases if prepared in a healthful 
way, as in traditional Mediterranean dietary patterns. Opt for cooking methods such 
as roasting, baking, or stir-  frying and limit rich sauces high in calories, saturated fat, 
trans fat, and sodium. Avoid open-  flame, high-  temperature cooking of meats.
Use nutrient-  rich eggs in the same way as other nutrient-  rich animal foods (i.e., in 
moderation as part of an overall healthy plant-  based dietary pattern). Eggs are a 
relatively inexpensive source of high-  quality protein and other important vitamins 
and minerals. In general, individuals at low risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease 
should be able to consume up to one whole egg per day with little concern about 
potential health risk.147
14Low Consumption 
of Milk and Moderate 
Consumption of Cheese 
and Yogurt
INTRODUCTION
Since ancient times, dairy products have been a part of everyday diets in many 
regions around the Mediterranean basin. Sheep’s and goat’s milk traditionally were 
the primary sources of dairy products, but today cow’s milk is increasingly used. 
Mediterranean diets, in general, are characterized by low consumption of milk as 
a beverage, while other dairy products, especially cheese and yogurt (yoghurt), are 
consumed almost every day in moderate amounts. Yogurt, a fermented milk product, 
has been a popular food in many Mediterranean regions for centuries, but cheese 
likely ranks as the foremost dairy product.
Most dairy foods, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt (even low-  fat versions), are 
good-  to- excellent sources of protein and calcium, and they provide significant 
amounts of many B vitamins. Some products also are fortified with vitamins A 
and D. Dairy foods, however, do not contain iron or have only very small amounts. 
Organic and hormone-  free milk are available in addition to regular milk. For indi -
viduals who are lactose intolerant , lactose-  free dairy products are available, as well 
as plant-  based milk and cheese products, such as soy, almond, and rice milks and 
soy cheese. Soy milk products contain higher amounts of protein than other types of 
plant-  based milk products. Plant-  based dairy products also provide a good alterna -
tive for individuals who have a milk allergy.
Highlight: Most dairy foods, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt (even low-  fat 
versions), are good-  to- excellent sources of protein and calcium and provide sig -
nificant amounts of many B vitamins.
Yogurt  is rich in protein, calcium, and potassium. As a fermented milk product, 
yogurt contains health-  promoting probiotic bacteria that may be beneficial to the 
gut microflora. To obtain optimal health benefits, look for yogurts that contain “live 
and active cultures” on refrigerated brands. Yogurt comes in a variety of formula -
tions, including plain, flavored, full fat, low fat, and nonfat. Greek-  style yogurts are 148 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
made by straining off some of the liquid whey, which results in a thicker product 
than regular yogurts. Greek-  style yogurts have approximately the same number of 
calories as regular yogurts but are higher in protein and lower in calcium than most 
other yogurts. Greek-  style yogurt has a rich and creamy mouth-  feel, even the fat- 
free versions.
Natural cheeses , such as feta, were used in traditional Mediterranean diets rather 
than processed cheeses, which often have added colorings and preservatives and 
less- distinctive flavor and texture than natural cheeses. Cheese is both nutrient dense 
and energy dense but, like milk, comes in forms that vary in fat content from high to 
low. Feta, a classic Greek cheese, has traditionally been made from goat’s or sheep’s 
milk. This white, crumbly cheese has a rich, tangy flavor, but it is typically high in 
sodium. It is available in precrumbled form or pressed into cakes and stored in its 
own salty brine. Feta products also come with herbs or other seasonings.
APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON DAIRY PRODUCTS TO REDUCE RISK 
OF OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES
A number of different studies have looked at the relationship between dairy intake 
and weight management or type 2 diabetes risk. In one report, dietary patterns with 
higher dairy intake had a strong inverse association with insulin resistance syndrome 
(IRS) among overweight young adults. Thus, dairy intake might help to reduce the 
risk of type 2 diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease in this population. Using 
data from the U.S. Nurses’ Health Study, scientists found that teenagers consuming 
a high amount of dairy foods had a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adult -
hood than teenagers who had a low dairy intake. In addition, women who had gained 
the least amount of weight in adulthood also had consumed the greatest amount of 
dairy when they were teens. Results from two recent studies indicated that consum -
ing the general recommendation of three dairy servings a day improved metabolic 
health and reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes.
A prospective study in middle-  aged or older women found that a dietary pattern 
incorporating a higher amount of low-  fat dairy products was linked to a lower risk 
of developing type 2 diabetes A similar study found that dietary patterns character -
ized by higher dairy consumption, especially from low-  fat dairy products, may lower 
type 2 diabetes risk in men. Other studies also have indicated a beneficial relation -
ship between consumption of low-  fat dairy products and type 2 diabetes risk in both 
men and women. Several studies have not shown positive effects, so an association 
between consumption of dairy products and risk of type 2 diabetes is suggested but 
remains inconclusive.
Vitamin D has been shown to affect blood sugar regulation, and low blood lev -
els of this vitamin have been associated with increased insulin resistance. A meta- 
analysis of 21 prospective studies showed that higher blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D 
levels were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in diverse populations of 
both men and women. Results from several studies also suggest that calcium-  rich 
diets play a direct role in prevention of obesity. Findings from one report indicated a 149 Low Consumption of Milk and Moderate Consumption of Cheese and Yogurt
diet high in dairy calcium from low-  fat dairy products enhanced weight reduction in 
patients with type 2 diabetes. A 2-year study of overweight women and men found 
that those who consumed more calcium and vitamin D from dairy products had 
greater weight loss than other study participants who consumed less. Some studies, 
however, have not found favorable effects, so the role of calcium and vitamin D in 
relation to weight management and type 2 diabetes risk remains controversial.
Diets containing calcium and vitamin D as supplements, rather than from dairy 
products alone, also have been investigated. Again, results have been inconsistent 
concerning an association between these supplements and weight management and 
risk of type 2 diabetes. Calcium and vitamin D, however, may exert different effects 
on managing weight than in lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes; health benefits may 
depend on whether these nutrients come from regular or fortified dairy products, 
from other food sources of calcium and vitamin D, or from supplements. Other com -
ponents of dairy products, or different dietary patterns incorporating dairy products, 
also may play a role.
Abundant evidence, however, supports the need for individuals to maintain opti -
mal amounts of calcium and vitamin D from foods to obtain possible benefit on both 
weight and type 2 diabetes and a possible reduction in risk of osteoporosis. Low-  fat 
dairy sources provide a good way to help achieve optimal intakes of these nutrients 
without adding extra calories. Full-  fat cheese still can be part of a healthy diet if 
consumed less frequently and portion sizes are kept small.
Highlight: Abundant evidence, however, supports the need for individuals to 
maintain optimal amounts of calcium and vitamin D from foods to obtain pos -
sible benefit on both weight and type 2 diabetes and a possible reduction in risk 
of osteoporosis.
APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON DAIRY PRODUCTS TO REDUCE RISK 
OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
Milk consumption long has been considered a significant risk factor for coronary 
heart disease (CHD) because of its saturated fat content. Evidence from some studies 
shows a correlation between a high intake of whole milk, butter, and other high-  fat, 
especially saturated fat, dairy products and an increased CHD risk. An overview of 
prospective cohort studies of milk consumption and heart disease, however, found 
no convincing evidence that milk consumption had adverse effects on the vascu -
lar system. In fact, this study suggested that drinking milk might be related to a 
small but worthwhile reduction  in heart disease and stroke risk. A number of other 
studies have examined a possible association between milk consumption and risk 
factors for heart disease, but these results are inconsistent. Therefore, at present, 
milk consumption is not supported by research findings to have either a positive or a 
negative relationship with risk of heart disease. A number of studies, however, have 150 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
observed a beneficial relationship between dairy product consumption and metabolic 
syndrome in both men and women.
Studies examining an association between CHD risk and dairy products other 
than milk also show conflicting results. Many studies, however, do not take into 
account the wide range of dairy foods of differing composition and how each type 
might uniquely affect heart disease risk. Currently, no strong evidence exists to sup -
port that dairy products increase the risk of heart disease in healthy men and women. 
Whereas increasing calcium intake from food is inconclusive in conferring cardio -
vascular benefits, some evidence suggests that taking high amounts of calcium in 
supplements may have adverse effects, including an increased risk of myocardial 
infarction and arterial calcification.
Vitamin D-  fortified milk and other fortified dairy products may offer additional 
benefits to heart health. Results from one study suggested an association between 
optimal blood levels of vitamin D and lower heart disease death in subjects with 
the metabolic syndrome. Findings from other studies indicated that people with low 
blood levels of vitamin D have higher risk for heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. 
Several ways have been hypothesized by which vitamin D may protect the heart, 
including helping to lower blood pressure, regulate inflammation, or reduce calcifi -
cation of coronary arteries, but no mechanism has yet been established.
A major clinical trial assessing effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure, 
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), found that a diet rich in fruits, 
vegetables, and low-  fat dairy products, along with reduced total and saturated fats 
could significantly lower blood pressure, a risk factor for heart disease. Follow-  up 
studies found that reducing sodium intake in addition to following the DASH diet 
helped reduce blood pressure even further.
RECOMMENDATIONS ON NUMBER OF SERVINGS 
AND SERVING SIZES OF DAIRY PRODUCTS
Given that many dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, contain important 
micronutrients, such as calcium, and contain protein of high biological value, the 
Mediterranean Diet Pyramid suggests moderate portions of cheese and yogurt on 
a daily-  to- weekly basis, with preference given to low-  fat versions (see Chapter  1, 
Figure 1.3). The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends two to three 
dairy servings per day (Table 14.1). Emphasis also is placed on the consumption of 
low- fat or fat-  free milk and other dairy products. Calcium is contained in the nonfat 
part of milk, so that lower-  fat dairy foods have slightly more of this mineral than 
full- fat products. Some foods made from milk contain little calcium, including ice 
cream and cream cheese, while others, such as cream and butter, contain almost 
no calcium. Therefore, these milk products are not included as part of the dairy 
food group.151 Low Consumption of Milk and Moderate Consumption of Cheese and Yogurt
BOTTOM LINE
Traditional Mediterranean diets rarely used milk as a beverage, but cheese and 
yogurt made from sheep’s and goat’s milk typically were eaten daily in moderate 
amounts. Findings from different studies concerning an association between dairy 
products and weight management or risk of type 2 diabetes have been inconsistent. If 
adding dairy products to your diet to help with weight loss, it is important to decrease 
caloric intake from other foods that are energy dense and low in essential nutri -
ents. The debate regarding dairy consumption and potential risk for CHD continues. 
Other studies examining diets supplemented with calcium and vitamin D also have 
shown inconsistent results.
Nevertheless, consuming recommended amounts of calcium and vitamin D is 
essential for good health, including bone health. Milk and other dairy products also 
contribute high biological protein to an overall healthful diet. Used in moderation, as 
in most Mediterranean diets, and if low in saturated fat and trans fat, dairy foods are 
not likely to provide any negative effects on heart health and may provide beneficial 
effects, including reduction in blood pressure. Full-  fat dairy products (i.e., mainly 
cheeses) can be part of a healthy diet if consumed less often and in small  portions, 
but low-  fat (1%) milks and other dairy products are recommended because they are 
so frequently consumed. Nondairy products, especially those fortified with calcium 
and vitamin D, may serve as good substitutes for individuals with milk allergies or 
who are lactose intolerant.TABLE  14.1

15Moderate Consumption 
of Alcohol
INTRODUCTION
Alcohol consumption, typically red wine, has been an integral part of most 
Mediterranean dietary patterns, the main exception being Muslim populations. 
Typically, wine is consumed daily in moderate amounts during unhurried meals. In 
the United States, however, alcoholic beverages tend to be consumed erratically, 
often with heavier weekend consumption and often not with meals. While wine con -
tinues to be a popular drink with everyday meals in most Mediterranean nations, 
consumption of beer and distilled spirits gradually has been increasing.
Traditionally, alcohol was used in moderation, and alcoholism was rare; the con -
sumption of wine was not associated with alcohol abuse. Wine contains the same 
vitamins and minerals found in grapes, but in such small amounts that the impact on 
human nutrition is minimal. Wine does, however, contain phytochemicals that are 
considered to provide health benefits, but red wine with skin extractions contains 
greater amounts of these molecules than white wines. The alcohol calories of wine 
do contribute to overall caloric intake, but other energy sources, such as fat, are typi -
cally the critical providers of dietary calories.
The key to achieving possible health benefits from alcohol consumption depends 
on following the definition of moderate drinking . The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans defines moderate alcohol consumption as daily consumption of up to one 
standard  drink per day for women and up to two standard drinks per day for men.
Consuming large amounts of alcohol may contribute to excessive energy intake 
and lead to obesity, disturb carbohydrate and glucose metabolism, induce pancre -
atitis, and impair liver function through excessive fat accumulation. Data from the 
long-  running Nurses’ Health Study indicated that even low levels of alcohol con -
sumption were associated with a small increase in breast cancer risk. In addition, 
alcohol consumption throughout adult life was independently associated with breast 
cancer risk. Binge drinking  is known to have serious health and social consequences. 
Definitions of binge drinking range from having four to six or more alcoholic bever -
ages in one sitting, with women at the lower end of this range.
Drinking any type of alcohol should be avoided by some people, including chil -
dren, pregnant and lactating women, women who may become pregnant, individuals 
who are unable to limit their alcohol intake, individuals on medications that can 
interact with alcohol, and individuals with certain medical conditions. For those 
who do not currently consume alcohol, it is not recommended to begin drinking 
alcohol for the sole purpose of obtaining a possible health benefit as excessive 154 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
consumption clearly has adverse health effects. Individuals can follow other, more 
important dietary recommendations to help reduce risks of type 2 diabetes, car -
diovascular diseases (CVDs), and other chronic diseases. Lifestyle behaviors, such 
as engaging in regular physical activity and not smoking, also play a major role in 
disease prevention.
APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON ALCOHOL TO REDUCE RISK 
OF TYPE 2 DIABETES
The relationship between alcohol consumption and type 2 diabetes has been a topic 
of interest to researchers for a number of years. An association between alcohol con -
sumption and elevated glucose levels had been postulated and raised concerns that 
alcohol intake may increase type 2 diabetes risk. This concern dissipated when data 
from a large prospective cohort study of more than 85,000 women provided no sup -
port for the hypothesis that moderate alcohol consumption increased type 2 diabetes 
risk. In fact, many studies show that light-  to- moderate alcohol consumption is asso -
ciated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with zero alcohol consumption. 
Alcohol likely acts through several different mechanisms in helping to decrease risk 
of type 2 diabetes, including the slowing of glucose uptake from a meal.
Highlight: Many studies show that light-  to- moderate alcohol consumption is asso -
ciated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with zero alcohol consumption.
Data from one study indicated that, in healthy men and women, light-  to- moderate 
alcohol consumption was also associated with enhanced insulin sensitivity. Findings 
from a large study of men free from diabetes, CVD, and cancer who self-  selected for 
moderate alcohol intake had reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Another study exam -
ining alcohol consumption and incidence of type 2 diabetes found that moderate 
alcohol intake in men and women was associated with reduced incidence of type 2 
diabetes compared with very low alcohol intake. Binge drinking and high alcohol 
intake, however, indicated an increased type 2 diabetes risk, especially in women.
Drinking patterns , in addition to amounts of alcohol consumed, also appear to 
play an important role in the development of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. Data 
collected and analyzed from more than 37,000 women and men who had never 
smoked revealed that body mass index (BMI) was associated with how much alcohol 
an individual consumed on the days the individual drank. Individuals who consumed 
the smallest amount (one drink per drinking day) with the greatest frequency (3 to 
7 days/  week) had the lowest BMI.
Highlight: Drinking patterns , in addition to amounts of alcohol consumed, also 
appear to play an important role in the development of both type 2 diabetes and 
obesity.155 Moderate Consumption of Alcohol
Several reasons have been suggested concerning the association between a high 
BMI and a high quantity of alcohol intake, including the following:
• Alcohol can be a significant source of calories.
• Liquid calories may not produce the same feeling of satiety as do calories 
from solid foods.
• Drinking, especially in a social setting, may stimulate eating as well as 
more drinking.
Results from another study of drinking patterns in relation to type 2 diabetes 
risk among men found that consuming one to two alcoholic drinks per day was 
associated with a 36% lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared with no alcohol con -
sumption. The type of alcoholic beverage—wine, beer, or distilled spirits—did not 
change the results. Frequency of alcohol intake also was found to be inversely asso -
ciated with risk of type 2 diabetes. Alcohol consumption on at least 5 days/  week 
appeared to offer the most protection, even when less than one drink per drinking 
day was consumed.
APPLYING THE EVIDENCE ON ALCOHOL TO REDUCE RISK 
OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
Substantial evidence from numerous types of studies indicates an inverse relation -
ship between moderate alcohol consumption and CVD risk. Findings from some 
studies suggest that men and women who regularly consume one to two alcoholic 
drinks a day (i.e., moderate drinkers) have a lower risk of heart disease compared 
to nondrinkers. The benefit of moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a 
lower risk of total mortality, CVD, CVD death, heart attack or myocardial infarc -
tion (MI), fatal MI, and coronary heart disease (CHD). Any potential heart benefit 
gained from alcohol consumption rests strongly on moderate  consumption. As stated 
previously, excessive alcohol intake is associated with multiple well-  known adverse 
health effects.
Highlight: Any potential heart benefit gained from alcohol consumption rests 
strongly on moderate  consumption.
A systematic review and meta-  analysis focused on alcohol consumption and 
selected cardiovascular outcomes. Findings indicated that light-  to- moderate alcohol 
consumption, relative to nondrinkers, was associated with a reduced risk of several 
cardiovascular outcomes, including CVD mortality, incident CHD, CHD mortality, 
incident stroke, and stroke mortality. Data from the Spanish cohort of the European 
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) were analyzed to explore 
the association between alcohol intake and CHD. Alcohol intakes that were moder -
ate to very high in men were all associated with a more than 30% lower rate of CHD. 
Alcohol intake was also associated with reduced risk of CHD in women, but the 156 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
results were not statistically significant, possibly due to the lower number of coro -
nary events in women compared to men. Even though the highest levels of alcohol 
intake in this study were still associated with a reduction in CHD risk in men, it 
cannot be emphasized enough that excessive alcohol intake also is associated with 
several other adverse health effects.
A cohort of 8,867 men of the Health Professionals Follow-  Up Study participated 
in a prospective study investigating the association between alcohol consumption 
and CHD risk in men with healthy lifestyles. The men were free of major illness and 
reported engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors. All participants had a BMI less than 
25, exercised for 30 minutes or more per day, abstained from smoking, and followed 
a diet high in fruits, vegetables, cereal fiber, fish, chicken, nuts, soy, and polyunsatu -
rated fat. Results indicated that even in men already at reduced risk for heart disease, 
moderate alcohol intake, compared with abstention from alcohol, was associated 
with lower risk for MI. Another study analyzed alcohol intake and risk of CVD pro -
spectively in large representative samples of the U.S. population using information 
from the National Health Interview Survey. Findings of this report suggested that 
light and moderate drinkers had significantly lower risk of death from CVD than did 
alcohol abstainers and heavy drinkers. The risk reduction was similar among men 
and women and among different age categories.
Results for a cohort study of over 1,300 men indicated that long-  term light alcohol 
intake, less than or equal to 20 g per day, compared with no alcohol, lowered cardio -
vascular risk and all-  cause mortality risk and increased life expectancy. Men who 
consumed modest amounts of wine each day compared with men who did not drink 
alcohol had an increased life expectancy about 5 years longer.
Available evidence suggests that a regular and moderate intake of any type of 
alcoholic beverage (i.e., wine, beer, or liquor) provides similar cardiovascular ben -
efits. The ethanol content of alcoholic beverages repeatedly has been shown to raise 
slightly the blood concentrations of “good” high-  density lipoprotein (HDL) choles -
terol and to prolong clot formation, a benefit for most adults.
POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF RED WINE CONSUMPTION 
COMPARED TO OTHER TYPES OF ALCOHOL
Little data exist that indicate one type of alcohol provides significantly greater health 
benefits than another. Wine, however, has one advantage over other alcoholic drinks 
because it contains several unique phenolic compounds, one class of phytochem -
icals.  One phenolic compound in red wines is resveratrol , a polyphenolic phyto -
alexin. Phytoalexins are produced in certain plants as a defense against infection 
by pathogenic micro  organ  isms. Resveratrol may also exhibit alexin-  like activity in 
humans and has been reported to have cardioprotective benefits, as well as anti -
carcinogenic effects. A recent review summarized the cardiovascular effects and 
molecular targets of resveratrol, noting that this unique compound stimulates endo -
thelial production of nitric oxide, reduces oxidative stress, inhibits vascular inflam -
mation, and prevents platelet aggregation.  Red wines have much higher amounts of 
resveratrol than do white wines because during the wine-  making process the reds 157 Moderate Consumption of Alcohol
have extended time for the extraction from the rich phenol-  containing grape skins. 
Resveratrol,  along with other flavonoid and nonflavonoid phenolic molecules, also 
has antioxidant activities and continues to receive considerable research attention 
because of its potential health benefits.

molecules, also has antioxidant activities and continues to receive considerable

BOTTOM LINE
Alcohol consumption, especially of red wine, can be part of a healthy diet if used 
in ways similar to those in most Mediterranean dietary patterns that use alcohol: 
consumed mainly with a meal, especially a leisurely paced meal, and used regularly 
in moderation.
Moderate alcohol consumption is considered as up to one standard-  size drink for 
women and up to two standard-  size drinks for men daily or several times a week. 
Refer to Box 15.1 for definitions of the standard sizes of different alcoholic beverages.
Findings from numerous studies suggest that light-  to- moderate alcohol consump -
tion may offer some protection against the development of type 2 diabetes and CVDs. 
Alcohol consumption, however, is associated with both health benefits and health 
risks. Therefore, it is important to drink responsibly and, in some cases, to avoid 
alcohol use altogether.
BOX 15.1
One standard drink  is defined as containing approximately 0.6 fluid ounces 
(14 g) of alcohol (ethanol), and equals

• 1.5 fluid ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits (approximately 96 Calories)159
16High Consumption of 
Herbs, Spices, and Garlic
INTRODUCTION
A wide variety of native-  grown herbs long have been a part of Mediterranean cui -
sines, including rosemary, fennel, basil, dill, oregano, parsley, and marjoram. Spices, 
such as cinnamon, which also were used in traditional Mediterranean cooking, came 
from Asian nations by way of the spice trade. Herbs and spices often increase the 
palatability of many foods by heightening their aroma and flavor. These special plant 
foods, although used in small quantities, are frequently consumed in a variety of 
Mediterranean dishes and contribute to the enjoyment of eating. The Mediterranean 
Diet Pyramid places herbs, spices, and garlic in the large plant foods section at the 
base of the pyramid (see Chapter 1, Figure 1.2).
Herbs and spices have been used for centuries by humans for food and for their 
medicinal properties. A growing body of research indicates that herbs and spices 
may play a role in the prevention and treatment of many chronic diseases. There 
are few well-  designed and controlled studies, however, so the actual health ben -
efits from consuming these special plant foods have been suggested but generally 
not proven. Nevertheless, herbs, spices, and garlic contain high amounts of phyto -
chemicals, antioxidants, and other protective compounds, including some with anti- 
inflammatory properties. These compounds likely add in some small measure to 
the overall health benefits provided by a plant-  based dietary pattern. Results from 
several studies suggest that certain herbs and spices, including fenugreek and cin -
namon, as well as garlic, may have a therapeutic use in the management of both 
type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Herbs and spices contain little or no calories, so their use 
does not contribute to weight gain. Benefits to heart health may be provided by herbs 
and spices such as curcumin, fenugreek, coriander, cinnamon, capers, and ginger. 
Ginger contains constituents with anti-  inflammatory properties that likely contribute 
to heart health. Oregano has many antibacterial properties and has been noted to 
have high ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation. It is rich in antioxidants and contains 
small amounts of vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin K, iron, and manganese. 
Rosemary, a herb from an aromatic evergreen Mediterranean shrub, exhibits the 
highest ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation of all the herbs. It also contains natural 
anti- inflammatory compounds.
Highlight: Culinary herbs and spices may play a role in the prevention and treat -
ment of many chronic diseases.160 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
These seasonings also may cause adverse health effects, especially in high, 
concentrated doses, or they may interact negatively with certain medications. 
Nevertheless, herbs and spices sprinkled on foods or in amounts specified in recipes 
almost always can be safely consumed. Herbs and spices add unique and interesting 
flavors to foods and may reduce the need for additional fat and salt or salt-  containing 
seasonings typically used in both cooked and uncooked dishes.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON SELECTED HERBS AND SPICES 
WITH POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO HEALTH
Curcumin , the polyphenol in turmeric that gives it its yellow color, has been most 
common in Indian curries but can be found now in the cuisine of many other coun -
tries, including some Mediterranean countries. Curcumin has been shown in some 
small studies to have anti-  inflammatory, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antithrom -
botic, and cardiovascular protective effects. The antioxidant effects of curcumin may 
play a role in preventing diabetic cardiovascular complications, while its various other 
effects may reduce serum cholesterol levels and possibly protect against the patho -
logical changes that occur with atherosclerosis. In addition, the anti-  inflammatory 
effects of curcumin may possibly prevent atrial arrhythmias.
Fenugreek , an aromatic plant, has pleasantly bitter seeds and is native to south -
ern Europe and South Asia. The ground seeds are used to flavor many foods and 
are a prime ingredient in curry powder. Some spice blends and teas may contain 
fenugreek seeds. Fenugreek has been found to slow the absorption of carbohydrates, 
resulting in lower blood glucose levels in some people with diabetes. This glucose- 
lowering ability may be related to the high soluble fiber content of fenugreek seeds. 
Fenugreek also may have a possible cholesterol-  lowering effect.
Cinnamon , an ancient spice, is typically used in sweet dishes, but it also comple -
ments savory dishes such as curries and stews. The numerous compounds in cin -
namon, including flavonoids such as proanthocyanins, have been shown to exhibit 
antioxidant effects that may help reduce the risk of some chronic diseases. The active 
ingredient in cinnamon, which includes the chemical hydroxychalcone, may stimu -
late insulin receptors on cell membranes, which could help move glucose from the 
bloodstream into the body’s cells and tissues. Results from some studies suggest 
that small amounts of cinnamon may reduce postprandial blood glucose concen -
tration by slowing the rate at which the stomach empties after eating. One study 
showed improvement in the glucose concentration and lipid profile of participants 
with type 2 diabetes. Other studies, however, found little or no effect of cinnamon on 
blood glucose concentration. Also, no major studies have examined an association 
between cinnamon and prevention of type 2 diabetes.
Cinnamon use may cause blood glucose to be excessively lowered, resulting in 
hypoglycemia. This is a concern mainly in individuals with diabetes who are also 
using glucose-  lowering medications or insulin, so blood glucose levels should be 
checked frequently when using this spice.161 High Consumption of Herbs, Spices, and Garlic
Garlic , a bulbous, aromatic herb of the lily family, has been used widely for cen -
turies in many Mediterranean cuisines. It continues to be a highly valued addition to 
Mediterranean cuisines, both for the unique flavor it imparts to many dishes as well 
as for its possible therapeutic qualities. Allium vegetables, such as garlic, onions, 
shallots, leeks, and chives, are high in sulfur compounds, which give them their 
distinctive aroma and taste. A sulfur compound in garlic, allicin, is thought to offer 
health benefits for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), certain cancers, and 
other chronic diseases. In addition to allicin, garlic contains many other compounds 
that also may confer positive health effects. Evidence from some studies indicates 
that garlic consumption may increase secretion of insulin from B cells in the pan -
creas, as well as play a role in the prevention of obesity. Promising effects of garlic 
concerning cardiovascular health have been shown in a number of studies and meta- 
analyses. Findings suggest garlic to be effective in reducing total serum cholesterol 
and low-  density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as lowering blood pressure.
Highlight: A sulfur compound in garlic, allicin, is thought to offer health benefits for 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVDs), certain cancers, and other chronic diseases.
Findings from research, however, are not consistent or sufficiently strong at present 
to prove that garlic consumption, whether from food or supplements, provides any of 
these major health benefits. Garlic and other allium vegetables, however, likely make 
important contributions to plant-  based diets, such as the diverse Mediterranean diets.
Even if consuming garlic on a regular basis does turn out to provide some health 
benefits, it may be difficult to determine what an appropriate amount or dose may 
be or what form or preparation may confer the most benefits. Garlic supplements 
typically contain only some of the potentially beneficial compounds found in natural 
garlic, and some supplements do not meet label claims or may even contain con -
taminants. The garlic used in foods, on the other hand, contains a wide variety of 
compounds and is available as whole bulbs. Minced or chopped garlic may also be 
purchased in glass containers mixed with water or olive oil. Garlic products high in 
sodium, such as garlic salt, are best avoided.
Green tea , while not part of most traditional Mediterranean diets, can fit well into 
this way of eating as it is rich in polyphenols and antioxidant activity. These plant 
compounds may support cardiovascular health by helping to prevent capillary fra -
gility, maintain healthy cholesterol levels, protect endothelial function, and inhibit 
platelet aggregation. Findings from a number of studies suggest that drinking green 
tea is associated with reduced CVD risk as well as reduced CVD mortality. The 
flavonoids (i.e., an important group of plant antioxidants) in green tea may be more 
potent than the antioxidants in black tea because green tea undergoes little or no 
oxidation, compared to black tea, which undergoes more processing. Black tea and 
herbal teas, however, likely contain certain phytochemicals that also may be found 
to offer benefits to health.162 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
BOTTOM LINE
Herbs, spices, and garlic, commonly used in Mediterranean and other cuisines, con -
tain a wide array of phytochemical compounds that may play a role in the treatment 
and prevention of many chronic diseases. Improved health outcomes from consum -
ing these plant foods, however, have not been proven as yet in large, randomized con -
trolled trials (RCTs). Nevertheless, including a variety of herbs, spices, and garlic in 
daily meals will enhance the flavor of foods, reduce the need for additional salt, and 
contribute to the pleasure of eating. In general, it is safer and healthier to consume 
these unique seasonings in food rather than taking supplements unless prescribed by 
a physician.Section III
Eating the Mediterranean Way165
17Moving toward a 
Mediterranean-  Style 
Diet in Your Own Life
INTRODUCTION
This chapter focuses on five specific topics related to adopting a healthy Mediterranean-  
style diet in your own life.
 1. Transferring  the Mediterranean dietary pattern to non-  Mediterranean countries.
 2. Maintaining  a Mediterranean-  style diet.
 3.  Increasing  the health benefits of a vegetarian or vegan diet when following 
a Mediterranean eating pattern.
 4.  Choosing  foods when eating out that fit a Mediterranean-  style diet.
 5.  Taking  steps to begin moving toward a Mediterranean-  style diet.
TRANSFERRING THE MEDITERRANEAN DIETARY PATTERN 
TO NON-  MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES
Dietary patterns that represent the traditional cultures of Mediterranean nations have 
been transported to and reproduced in the United States as well as in other non- 
Mediterranean countries. Immigrants from different Mediterranean regions, espe -
cially restaurateurs and food marketers, have introduced the foods they typically 
eat and their ways of preparation to these other countries. Over time, local residents 
often begin to incorporate specific Mediterranean-  style dishes in their own diets.
The transfer aspect has not been well studied, but the few reports on transfer of the 
Mediterranean dietary pattern to non-  Mediterranean countries have been uniformly 
positive. The success of the transfer of the Mediterranean style of eating depends 
greatly on the acceptability and utilization by the peoples of the non-  Mediterranean 
nations. In general, the popularity of the Mediterranean dishes has resulted from 
their palatability and tastiness, as much as from their healthfulness. Several studies 
reported in the scientific literature are briefly reviewed next.
United States:  Most studies examining the transference of traditional 
Mediterranean dietary patterns to U.S. populations have focused on reduced 
death rates from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) or cancers. Other studies 
in the United States have investigated the effects of Mediterranean diets on 
risk factors for chronic diseases. A recent investigation of the Framingham 166 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Offspring Cohort looked at the effect of a Mediterranean-  style diet on the 
characteristic risk factors of the metabolic syndrome, specifically waist 
circumference, fasting plasma glucose concentration, serum triglycerides, 
and high-  density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration. The authors 
developed a Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern score to determine the 
conformity of 2,000 participants to a traditional Mediterranean dietary 
pattern. The study results suggest that the participants who were able to 
adapt to a Mediterranean-  style diet in this suburban town outside Boston 
were much more likely to reduce their risk of the metabolic syndrome. The 
researchers reported that the adherent subjects were less insulin resistant, 
and they had smaller waist circumference, lower blood values of glucose 
and triglycerides, and higher HDL cholesterol concentration than partici -
pants who did not adhere to the diet so well (Table 17.1). Similar results 
were found in a study in India.
India: The Indo-  Mediterranean diet represents a combination of Indian cui -
sine with Mediterranean cuisine after its introduction by researchers in 
Calcutta, India, almost a decade ago. A 2-year randomized study reported 
that the intervention group, which received mustard seed oil or soybean 
oil instead of olive oil in addition to more vegetables, fruits, nuts, and 
whole grains, had significantly lower risk of heart disease and other fea -
tures of the metabolic syndrome at the end of the study compared to a 
control group on their usual Indian diet. (No fish or meats were consumed 
by either group.) Although a few design issues have not been fully pro -
vided in the report of this study, it nevertheless demonstrated that the 
Mediterranean diet—without seafood—can be transferred to a highly 
different population with cultural food patterns quite distinct from the 
Mediterranean nations.
Australia:  An elderly population (>70 years of age) residing in Melbourne 
was evaluated regarding their acceptance of a traditional Mediterranean- 
style diet, including eight key features or principles of the dietary pattern. TABLE  17.1

A significant decline in mortality for all study subjects, hence longer sur -
vival, was observed after a 4- to 6-year follow-  up. The consumption of 
olive oil was a significant predictor of survival among those of Greek ori -
gin when compared to those with British backgrounds. The overall diet, 
however, rather than specific components was the best predictor of the 
survival benefit. The results of this study support the concept that transfer 
of a Mediterranean dietary pattern to other countries can be accepted and 
followed with benefits to health.
Canada:  Two significant declines in anthropometric measures, decreased 
body weight and decreased waist circumference, were found after 12 weeks 
in 77 women switching from their usual dietary pattern to a Mediterranean- 
style diet in Quebec City. Good adherents of this Mediterranean dietary pat -
tern, established by a dietary score of 11 components of the Mediterranean 
Diet Pyramid, had the greatest benefits in reductions of body weight and 
waist circumference.
Sweden:  Young adult women (30–49 years) in a cohort of 42,000 from the 
Uppsala region consuming a traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern were 
followed for 12 years. The women with high adherence had lower over -
all mortality, especially reduced cancer mortality in the 40- to 49-year-  old 
group. Therefore, even among relatively young adults, it was possible to 
modify usual dietary habits and follow a Mediterranean-  style diet over time 
that yielded improvements in health and reductions in mortality.
Published reports on the studies examining the transfer of a Mediterranean-  style 
dietary pattern to several non-  Mediterranean populations illustrate both the rela -
tively high satisfaction with the new “diet” and the fairly good retention of such a 
dietary pattern within nontraditional settings. Collectively, these studies suggest that 
different populations throughout the world that adopt a Mediterranean-  style diet may 
gain in terms of overall health, especially via reductions of heart disease, type 2 
diabetes, and diet-  related cancers. Several other chronic diseases of old age also may 
be reduced in both incidence and mortality. Thus, living longer while still in good 
health is more likely for good adherents of a Mediterranean dietary pattern.
MAINTAINING  A MEDITERRANEAN-  STYLE DIET
Once a Mediterranean dietary pattern has been introduced in a nation or popula -
tion, increasing the percentage of the population adopting and maintaining this 
way of eating becomes the next step. Improvement in dietary patterns, especially 
of large population groups, is the primary goal because it leads to lower CVD rates, 
type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, diet-  related cancers, and potentially other 
chronic diseases. Improvements may include additions of foods not normally con -
sumed, higher amounts of some foods currently used, or reduction of some foods 
regularly consumed. Dietary changes, especially when assisted by competent health 
professionals, especially registered dietitians (RDs), have been demonstrated in 
research intervention studies to reduce the risk factors of CVDs and hence of other 
diseases as well. The basis for the remarkable success of a Mediterranean-  style diet 168 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
is that it is more flexible, easy to follow, and palatable to consumers than the fre -
quently recommended low-  fat diets or very low-  carbohydrate diets, which typically 
eliminate many beneficial and delicious foods.
Highlight: Dietary changes, especially when assisted by competent health pro -
fessionals, especially registered dietitians (RDs), have been demonstrated in 
research intervention studies to reduce the risk factors of CVDs and hence of 
other diseases as well.
Strategies for maintaining a healthy way of eating are still being developed, but 
some strategies already have been identified as effective for improving the healthful -
ness of current diets and increasing the acceptability of a more Mediterranean-  style 
of eating. Nutrition interventions need to be meaningful and culturally relevant to 
successfully modify dietary and other lifestyle behaviors and to ensure long-  term 
adherence. Results from a 1-year assessment of a large randomized primary pre -
vention trial conducted in Spain, the PREDIMED study, showed that the nutrition 
interventions were effective in increasing adherence to Mediterranean-  type diets. 
See Chapter 5 for details of the Mediterranean dietary components in this study and 
the reduced incidence of cardiovascular events. The intervention components of the 
PREDIMED study involved individual motivational interviews, group educational 
sessions, user-  friendly written materials, self-  monitoring, goal setting, and tailored 
nutrition messages based on individual preferences, beliefs, and other aspects of 
health history.
Highlight: Nutrition interventions need to be meaningful and culturally relevant 
to successfully modify dietary and other lifestyle behaviors and to ensure long- 
term adherence.
A meta-  analysis in 2008 of 12 studies on adherence to a Mediterranean-  style diet 
in diverse populations reported a significant improvement in health status after sev -
eral years on this type of diet. Specific health-  related reductions were found in overall 
mortality, mortality from CVD, incidence of or mortality from cancer, and reduced 
incidence rates of both Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease (Table 17.2). An 
update on this meta-  analysis in 2010 included a larger number of subjects and studies 
and confirmed the earlier findings that adhering to a Mediterranean diet provided sig -
nificant and consistent protection in relation to incidence of major chronic diseases.
Highlight: Adhering to a Mediterranean diet provided significant and consistent 
protection in relation to incidence of major chronic diseases.169 Moving toward a Mediterranean-  Style Diet in Your Own Life
A study in premenopausal women 18–44 years of age reported adherence 
to the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score was associated with lower total 
and regional adiposity. The aMed diet score is a scale adapted from the traditional 
Mediterranean diet and is based on the dietary intake of nine components. Higher 
scores imply greater adherence. Another study used the modified-  Mediterranean 
Diet Score (mMDS), a variant of the Mediterranean diet score as it had potential wide 
applicability in non-  Mediterranean countries. Study results suggested that, in both 
men and women, greater adherence to a modified Mediterranean diet high in foods 
of vegetable origin and unsaturated fatty acids was associated with lower abdominal 
adiposity. Findings from the Amsterdam Growth and Health Longitudinal Study 
indicated that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet in adolescence and early 
adulthood of women between the ages of 13 and 36 may help prevent arterial stiff -
ness in adulthood. These studies and others highlight the mounting evidence for the 
beneficial health effects of long-  term adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern 
and reduction of risk factors for various chronic diseases.
Individual or family acceptance and adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern 
is generally enhanced by both the real or perceived health benefits and the reduced 
risks of the several chronic diseases highlighted in this book. Making dietary changes 
is not easy, but familiarity with the foods and the healthy ways of preparing the foods 
so common among Mediterranean nations increases the likelihood of adopting this 
way of eating. One of the biggest health benefits derives from consuming a variety of 
plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, and whole grains in 
daily meals, the keys to healthy eating across the life cycle.

for animal meats, fish, eggs, and dairy foods. Most vegan diets are considered to be 
quite healthy, but vegans might even improve their usual diets and health by making 
a few modifications, such as the following:
• Aim for a wider variety of foods within each specific plant food group to 
obtain the many different beneficial nutrients, fibers, and phytochemicals 
unique to each food. For example, include fruits such as berries, citrus 
fruits, melons, mango, papaya, and stone fruits (i.e., peaches, plums, and 
apricots), among many others.
• Choose more whole grains and 100% whole-  grain products over highly 
refined and processed flour-  based products to maximize intakes of impor -
tant micronutrients, dietary fiber, and plant molecules.
• Use a variety of legumes, such as split peas, lentils, black beans, and kidney 
beans, more often than white potatoes to boost protein and dietary fiber intakes.
• Consume more garlic, onions, and other herbs and spices to take advantage 
of their potential health benefits as well as their flavors and their capacity to 
heighten the palatability of many foods.
• Increase consumption of mushrooms and other edible fungi to provide cer -
tain nutrients and antioxidants, such as selenium.
• Substitute monounsaturated virgin and extra virgin-  olive oils, as well as 
some vegetable oils high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as canola oil, for other 
less- healthy oils containing high amounts of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) 
and trans-  fatty acids.
• Eat both raw and cooked foods and cook foods in a healthy way (i.e., by 
steaming, roasting, baking, or stir-  frying) rather than deep-  fat frying.
• Make or use moderate amounts of healthy sauces, salad dressings, or other 
toppings that are low in SFAs and trans-  fatty acids, sodium, and added sugars.
• Drink red wine in moderation with the main meal of the day if already 
consuming alcohol of some kind.
CHOOSING FOODS WHEN EATING OUT THAT FIT 
A MEDITERRANEAN-  STYLE DIET
Eating out, whether at fast-  food places, restaurant chains, or other types of restau -
rants, presents a challenge in selecting foods that are not only tasty and satisfying but 
also good for our health. Both food quality  and food quantity  need to be considered. 
Being aware of what the food you eat contains and how it is prepared and using com -
mon sense all contribute to making food choices that will help with weight manage -
ment and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Less-  healthy foods, such as those high 
in calories, saturated fat, sodium (salt), and sugar, can still be part of a healthy diet, 
but these foods need to be eaten less frequently and in smaller portions. The list that 
follows offers a few ways to guide you in selecting menu items and portion sizes that 
would fit reasonably well in a Mediterranean-  style meal. For additional tips, refer 
to the appropriate chapter on a particular food group of interest, such as meats and 
poultry, dairy products, or fats.171 Moving toward a Mediterranean-  Style Diet in Your Own Life
• Plan ahead (most fast-  food places and restaurant chains have websites that 
give nutritional information for their menu items) and find out the healthier 
choices. Some places have a brochure that gives this information; ask for one.
• Call beforehand if you have special needs and ask if the restaurant can 
accommodate your request, such as gluten-  free items.
• Ask for substitutions that are more nutritious, such as a fresh fruit cup 
instead of potato salad or a small side salad instead of fries.
• Opt for one bread item (or none), if provided before the meal arrives, or a small 
handful of tortilla chips or crispy noodles and then have the rest removed.
• Choose half portions of entrees, share larger portions, or take half home.
• Select lower-  sodium foods. Many salad dressings, soy and teriyaki sauces, 
soups, and foods that are pickled or smoked often are high in sodium.
• Learn the descriptive terms that, in general, indicate a food is high in calories, 
fat, sodium, or sugar, including au gratin, Alfredo sauce, batter dipped, breaded, 
creamy, crispy, fritters, Béarnaise and Hollandaise sauces, and tempura.
• Know healthy preparation methods, such as baking, broiling, grilling, 
roasting, poaching, steaming, and stir-  frying, in place of fried and deep- 
fried methods.
• Aim for the leaner cuts of meat and poultry, such as tenderloin, sirloin, or 
chicken and turkey breast (skin removed).
• Substitute more fish, including salmon and other fish high in omega-3 fatty 
acids, in place of some red meat.
• Opt for smaller portions of starchy foods and choose some whole-  grain 
pastas, brown or wild rice, and sweet potatoes, but go easy on the toppings 
and sauces.
• Select mainly unsweetened beverages, especially water.
• Order more or larger portions of vegetables, both raw and cooked. Have a 
mixed-  green salad and choose a variety of vegetables (without sauces) at 
different meals.
• Have salad dressings “on the side” and use only one small container or 
one packet.
• Use lemon juice or vinegar to heighten the flavor of some foods.
• Bring little packets of your favorite herbs and spices, or some nuts and 
seeds, from home to sprinkle on foods for added taste.
• Have a lighter meal if planning on dessert and order a small dessert portion, 
share dessert with others, or take dessert home for another day.
• Eat slowly and enjoy your food.

home, as well as other helpful food-  related tips. Some organizations also have pam -
phlets on various nutrition topics that you can request, including the following:

TAKING STEPS TO BEGIN MOVING TOWARD 
A MEDITERRANEAN-  STYLE DIET
The foundation of all Mediterranean-  style diets is the high consumption of plant 
foods, along with moderate consumption of some animal foods. The steps listed in 
this section suggest one way to begin moving toward this healthy dietary pattern. 
These steps can be taken in any order, depending on individual preferences. Also, 
refer back to this chapter’s sections on vegan eating  and eating out  for additional 
suggestions, as well as explanations for why these steps are critical for good health.
 1. Increase the amounts and variety of fruits and vegetables that you typically 
consume in daily meals.
 2. Have more meals with a variety of protein-  rich legumes playing a central 
role or add them to soups and salads.
 3. Consume more whole-  grain foods, such as oatmeal and brown rice, and 
foods made with whole-  grain flours, such as certain breads and cereals, and 
eat breads and grains that are less highly processed. Look for food labels 
that state 100% whole grain.
 4. Substitute olive oil, especially virgin and extra-  virgin types, for other less- 
healthy oils.
 5. Include more fish, especially fatty fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and 
reduce the intake of red meats and processed meat products, such as lun -
cheon meats and others high in sodium or containing nitrites and nitrates.
 6. Drink red wine in moderation with the main meal of the day, which may 
bring additional health benefits to those who already consume alcohol 
because of its unique phytochemical content.
 7. Drink more water and other unsweetened beverages, such as flavored seltzers, 
in place of sweetened beverages. Limit fruit juice and use more whole fruit.
 8. Eat fast foods and other processed foods less often and emphasize fresh, 
locally grown foods whenever possible.
Many preprepared deli foods and other processed packaged foods typically do 
not provide enough of the fruits, vegetables, and other plant foods needed as part of 
a healthy Mediterranean-  style diet. In addition, deli and packaged foods often provide 
excessive amounts of sodium, phosphorus, and other preservatives, and their fat content 
is usually too low in monounsaturated fatty acids (MFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (PFAs), especially omega-3 PFAs. The exception would be fatty fish that are rich 
in omega-3 PFAs. Olive oil or canola oil generally is replaced with less-  healthy oils, 
and garlic and onions usually are low or absent. These meals also tend to be high in 
full- fat or saturated-  fat milk-  based products, cheeses, and animal meats. So, the basic 
food components that make up a healthy Mediterranean-  style diet are lacking. Finally, 
food portions are often too large and can result in a high-  calorie intake for a single meal.
Highlight: Deli and packaged foods often provide excessive amounts of sodium, 
phosphorus, and other preservatives, and their fat content is usually too low in 
MFAs and PFAs, especially omega-3 PFAs.173 Moving toward a Mediterranean-  Style Diet in Your Own Life
SUMMARY
The Mediterranean dietary pattern can transfer well to many populations or cul -
tures throughout the world. In the United States, because many immigrant popula -
tions from the diverse nations of the Mediterranean basin have popularized their 
food patterns, these dietary offerings have become well accepted by the other non- 
Mediterranean populations. Adherence to this dietary pattern can be boosted by the 
palatability, flexibility, and ease of preparation of many basic dishes. Also, knowl -
edge about the foods that are found in this way of eating and why they promote 
better health and lower mortality from many chronic diseases may contribute in a 
significant way to adherence.
Fruits and vegetables especially provide good amounts of important vitamins and 
minerals along with fiber and a wide variety of plant molecules that aid health in 
many ways, such as through antioxidant activities. All plant foods, however, contain 
a variety of these beneficial components and carry out the same functions despite 
the different arrays of plant foods consumed by Mediterranean nations or by those in 
Okinawa, other parts of Japan, or India, for example. Plant foods remain the main -
stays of Mediterranean and the other diets, and they provide major health benefits 
because of the nutrients  and nonnutrients contained in them.
Although Mediterranean-  style diets do not represent a strict homogeneous dietary 
pattern, still many common food items and methods of preparation exist to recom -
mend this pattern as a healthy and enjoyable one for diverse populations. The major 
traditional dietary components that predict lower mortality and greater longevity, 
as found in the Greek cohort of the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into 
Cancer and Nutrition) study, are low consumption of meat and meat products; high 
consumption of vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, and olive oil; and moderate intake 
of alcohol (i.e., wine). Other contributions were attributed to cereal grains, dairy 
products, and fish and other seafood in a recent analysis of data in this study. The 
large prospective investigations of diet and disease in several Mediterranean nations, 
such as the PREDIMED study in Spain, remain reasonably consistent in their con -
clusions that adherence to a traditional Mediterranean-  style diet promotes health and 
reduces risk of many chronic diseases.
Even people who are vegetarians or vegans can often reap greater health ben -
efits when incorporating some of the principles of a Mediterranean-  style diet into 
their own customary diet. Eating out at restaurants and other food places typically 
presents a challenge in finding a variety of nutritious foods prepared in a healthy 
way and in appropriate portion sizes. The guidelines put forth in this chapter will 
aid in selecting menu items that would fit reasonably well in a Mediterranean-  style 
meal. Finally, the suggestions for specific steps to follow will help you to begin mov -
ing toward a Mediterranean-  style diet in your own life and to enjoy good food and 
good health.175

INTRODUCTION
Mediterranean diets have been investigated for more than 50 years by many researchers, 
especially from Greece, Italy, and Spain. Study findings consistently have shown that 
consumers of these diets reap numerous health benefits, including improved glucose 
regulation and reduction of type 2 diabetes and certain cancers, improved cardiovascu -
lar function, and increased longevity. Note that the earliest published reports on health 
benefits of a Mediterranean-  style diet focused on heart disease, especially heart attack, 
which was lower in many of the Mediterranean nations than in the United States and 
most northern European countries. Now, with the great increases in obesity and type 2 
diabetes and diet-  related cancers, new value is attained when following Mediterranean 
dietary patterns for the prevention of other diseases as well.
Along with diet, other lifestyle factors, such as regular physical activity and 
avoidance of cigarette smoking, are now considered strong determinants of health 
promotion and disease prevention. These healthy behaviors have played prominent 
roles in the favorable health outcomes of Mediterranean populations, especially the 
indigenous coastal people. In addition, several studies have shown that the healthy 
dietary patterns are readily transferable to non-  Mediterranean nations of the world.
The major question remains: What is the magic that makes the different 
Mediterranean patterns of eating so beneficial to health and longevity? This final 
chapter brings together the significant components of a Mediterranean-  style dietary 
pattern and highlights the major health benefits that derive from this way of eating. 
Emphasis is placed on the total diet, how it relates to other lifestyle issues, and how 
you can make a difference in your own life by eating the Mediterranean way. Refer 
to Chapter 1 for a visual representation of the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid, which 
suggests the frequency and amounts of healthy foods to consume, as well as empha -
sizing the importance of exercise and eating together with family and friends.
THE TOTAL DIET AND THE SLOWER LIFESTYLE
The traditional slower-  paced lifestyles of the Mediterranean people, along with 
healthy eating behaviors, make significant contributions to good health and longev -
ity. The enjoyment of familiar nutritious foods and dishes in the company of family 
is the traditional way of living in practically all Mediterranean nations. Lifestyle is 
characterized by home-  prepared meals, typically using locally grown foods, and by 176 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
family conversation for lengthy periods. This healthy Mediterranean pattern of eat -
ing is quite different from populations of most Western nations, where family meals 
are usually less common, and fast-  food meals may predominate.

HEALTH BENEFITS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN PATTERN 
OF EATING: FOCUS ON THE DIETARY COMPONENTS 
THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTH
The issue of the dietary components that contribute to health, while simple on the sur -
face, is not so easy to analyze. Clearly, the diets of the Mediterranean region are palatable 
and “likable.” Specific nutrient components and the foods providing these components, 
however, must hold part of the answer to this question. The overall quantity or volume of 
food that derives from plants must be important, both for the nutrients and nonnutrient 
fiber molecules and beneficial phytochemicals. Overall energy intake from total food 
intake cannot be so high that it leads to development of overweight and obesity; there -
fore, physical activity and other components of lifestyle must be reasonably optimal to 
support health. The answer—more complex than meets the eye—also must lie in the 
choice of specific food items that are culturally acceptable and even desirable.
As long as purchasing power is sufficient, foods consumed in Mediterranean 
nations enhance health because they provide practically all essential nutrients in suf -
ficient amounts to support cellular and extracellular functions (Figure 18.1).
Highlight: Foods consumed in Mediterranean nations enhance health because 
they provide practically all essential nutrients in sufficient amounts to support

In Chapters 4 to 6, major common life-  threatening chronic diseases have been 
targeted to show how specific foods and their nutrient components aid in promoting 
health and preventing disease. A few of these foods and nutrients or nutrient clusters 
that provide health benefits are summarized next.
Protein consumption is plentiful in the nations bordering the Mediterranean Sea, 
but only small amounts of red meat are consumed. Fish, whole grains, legumes, and 
other plant and animal foods provide sufficient protein to support health at all stages 
of the life cycle.

Omega-3 fatty acids commonly found in fatty fish and other seafood still are 
regularly consumed by Mediterranean peoples. Since less red meat is eaten, the ratio 
of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids is much more favorable, which confers health 
benefits if a lower ratio approaching 4 to 1 is operating. The exact ratio remains con -
troversial, but most experts agree that a low ratio is beneficial.
Monounsaturated fatty acids (MFAs) contained in olives and olive oil, espe -
cially virgin olive oils, are a major component of Mediterranean diets. MFAs have 
well-  established inhibitory effects on the serum triglyceride concentration, whereas 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFAs), in general, help lower serum total cholesterol, 
especially when it is elevated.
Calcium and vitamin D intakes typically are adequate because of cheese and 
yogurt consumption for calcium and fatty fish consumption for vitamin D. In addi -
tion, vitamin D skin production occurs for longer periods during the extended 
“summer” months in Mediterranean nations because of their nearness to the equa -
tor. These two nutrients help promote healthy bone formation and maintenance, but 
vitamin D, per se , has other significant health effects on diverse organ systems as 
well as on the skeleton.
Iron intake is fairly high in the Mediterranean dietary pattern because of fish and 
some meat and poultry consumption, even though red meat intake is lower than for 
many non-  Mediterranean nations. Vegetable sources of iron provide good amounts of 
the non-  heme form of iron, whereas meats contain more of the heme form of iron. See 
further information on heme and non-  heme iron in Chapter 13. Iron has several enzy -
matic roles in the function of tissues, but it has major actions as part of metalloprotein 
complexes in carrying oxygen in red blood cells and storing oxygen in muscles.
Folic acid, also known as folate, is a B vitamin ingested in good amounts by 
Mediterranean populations because of wide use of dark-  green leafy vegetables. 
Folate has critical roles in cell replication and cell survival.
Other essential vitamin and mineral micronutrients are generally sufficient 
because of the balance among the foods consumed in typical Mediterranean diets. A 
wide variety of plant foods provide many of these micronutrients that support health 
through their diverse functions in tissues and organ systems.
Nonnutrient phytochemicals also are high in the diets of Mediterranean people 
because of their good intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts. Antioxidant 
phytomolecules from plant sources are considered to provide the counterbalance to 
the many pro-  oxidant metabolic products of common cellular pathways.
Dietary fiber, which is rich in legumes, other vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, 
improves gastrointestinal (GI) tract functions by slowing the flow of food materials 
in the stomach and improving laxation in the colon. Newer functions of fiber, also 
known as prebiotics, are being discovered concerning enhancing the beneficial effects 
of probiotics, such as live bacterial culture in yogurts, which reduce GI malfunction 
and chronic diseases. Pre- and probiotics act differently, but they appear to aid each 
other in small bowel digestion and absorption.
Wine, especially red wine, consumption seems to be beneficial if consumed in 
modest amounts on most days of the week along with meals. In part, benefits are con -
sidered to come from the alcohol per se, but the phytochemicals in red wine, primarily 
the antioxidant resveratrol, also benefit those consumers who already drink. Red wines 178 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
are processed differently from almost all white wines because the phytochemical-  rich 
skins remain with the wine for nearly the entire processing period.
HEALTH BENEFITS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN PATTERN OF EATING: 
FOCUS ON PREVENTION OF CHRONIC DISEASES
Mediterranean dietary patterns include many variations on  a theme of healthy eating, 
as well as the healthy behaviors associated with dietary selections. Despite diverse 
eating patterns among the Mediterranean nations, many basic foods and food groups 
remain fairly common to these diets, including fish and seafood, olive oil, fruits 
and vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds, cheeses, yogurts, and other fermented 
dairy foods. A few exceptions to the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid exist; for example, 
alcohol is not part of the dietary patterns of the Muslim nations, and different oils 
and meats may be utilized in certain regions or populations.
Highlight: Despite diverse eating patterns among the Mediterranean nations, 
many basic foods and food groups remain fairly common to these diets, includ -
ing fish and seafood, olive oil, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts and 
seeds, cheeses, yogurts, and other fermented dairy foods.
Research suggests that the major health benefits of a Mediterranean-  style diet are 
the reductions of morbidity and mortality from the following chronic debilitating 
diseases common in many Western countries:
• Overweight and obesity
• Type 2 diabetes mellitus
• Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and hypertension
• Metabolic syndrome
• Diet-  related cancers
• Other chronic debilitating diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and macular 
degeneration
• Polycystic ovary syndrome
• Arterial calcification
• Chronic kidney disease
• Immune defense
• Osteoporosis

style diet are reductions of morbidity and mortality from obesity, type 2 diabetes,

Nations that traditionally have followed the plant-  based Mediterranean eating pat -
terns have the lowest mortality rates, especially rates of ischemic heart disease and stroke, 
as compared to five other nations that do not follow such eating patterns (Table 18.1).179 Eat Like a Mediterranean
overWeight And obesity
Overweight and obesity typically have been less common among Mediterranean popu -
lations compared to many populations in other parts of the world. Several reasons, in 
addition to a good non-  obesigenic diet, contribute to better weight patterns, at least in 
those consuming more traditional Mediterranean diets. One factor is smaller portion 
sizes, and a second is slower eating amidst family members, with meals perhaps spread 
over an hour or more. “Fast-  food” meals in the past were rarely, if ever, consumed. TABLE 18.1

Also, snacking throughout the day and evening was not a part of the usual dietary 
pattern. Finally, an active lifestyle, including physical activities on a daily basis, is 
generally more demanding in the lives of Mediterranean peoples than for many others.

type 2 d iAbetes Mellitus
Because type 2 diabetes is linked strongly to obesity, many obese individuals are 
either diabetic or on the road to becoming diabetic subjects (i.e., prediabetic). In 
populations with less obesity, less diabetes will appear, and this truism has been 
borne out in studies around the world. Type 2 diabetes unfortunately contributes to 
arterial damage (pathology); hence, it typically leads to poor circulation at both the 
macro- and microvascular levels. The feet, eyes, and kidneys are especially affected, 
and amputations, blindness, and kidney failure commonly occur if blood glucose 
concentration is not well controlled over time. The Mediterranean eating style helps 
reduce body weight and fat accumulation as well as helping to maintain optimal 
blood glucose concentrations, which in turn reduces the risk of arterial damage.
cArdiov Ascul Ar diseAses
The evidence-  based support for reduction of risks for CVDs, including coronary 
heart disease and stroke, for those consuming a traditional Mediterranean-  style diet 
has been the most robust compared to other diseases. The lower rates of deaths from 
heart disease are especially impressive for France, Spain, and Italy. Several large 
prospective intervention trials have been conducted that support the heart-  healthy 
benefits of the overall Mediterranean dietary pattern. Also, certain foods common to 
Mediterranean diets appear to have benefits by lowering the risks of CVDs.
The Mediterranean dietary pattern clearly supports healthy heart function, espe -
cially when coupled with regular physical activity that helps control body weight at a 
healthy level (body mass index [BMI] < 25). Cigarette smoking has long been estab -
lished as a risk factor for CVDs. Excessive alcohol consumption also is a major risk 
factor, but modest consumption is considered to be heart healthy. Modest amounts, 
such as no more than two 5-ounce glasses of wine a day for men or one 5-ounce 
glass a day for women, are thought to benefit heart and arterial health, partly through 181 Eat Like a Mediterranean
increasing high-  density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and reducing activity of the 
central nervous system, leading to lower blood pressure.
Highlight: The Mediterranean dietary pattern clearly supports healthy heart 
function, especially when coupled with regular physical activity that helps con -
trol body weight at a healthy level (BMI < 25).
the MetAbolic syndro Me
Five physiological abnormalities of body function contribute to the metabolic syn -
drome, which only recently has been identified as a major reason for high morbidity 
and mortality rates of heart diseases and type 2 diabetes in the United States. If an indi -
vidual has three of the five abnormalities, his or her risk of death typically increases 
in a geometric fashion or exponentially (rather than arithmetically) (see  Chapter  5, 
Box 5.1). The critical initial risk factor for all of the abnormalities of this syndrome 
is abdominal obesity and increased girth. So, eating according to the Mediterranean 
pattern without supersize servings and excessive consumption—coupled with other 
healthy lifestyle behaviors, especially daily physical activity—prevents or delays prac -
tically all of these abnormal conditions.
diet- relAted cAncers
The micronutrients, particularly the antioxidant micronutrients (vitamins C and E, 
β- carotene, and selenium), phytochemicals, and dietary fiber, are generally consid -
ered to be chemopreventive against several major cancers. The linkages that exist 
between various dietary risk factors and diet-  related cancers are somewhat specu -
lative, but a high-  energy intake unbalanced by regular exercise has an enormous 
stimulus for the growth of initiated cancer cells. Hence, such a high-  energy diet may 
interfere with the normal functioning of the various organ systems, hasten aging, 
and lower longevity. On the other hand, antioxidants, rich in plant foods, may help 
prevent cancer development. Long-  term cigarette smokers, however, are not likely 
to benefit as much from such healthy diets because of growth of previously initiated 
cancers, especially those of the lungs.
The annual cancer death rates in the United States are increasing, but they could 
possibly be reduced by about 30% to 35% through the adoption of a Mediterranean 
dietary pattern. In addition, a healthier lifestyle, especially through regular physical 
activity and not smoking, could possibly have an additional reduction in overall can -
cer rates in the United States. The major boost of Mediterranean diets is the increase 
in the number of servings of fruits and vegetables consumed each day, up to nine 
servings according to the current recommendations, based on a 2,000-Calorie diet. 
A Mediterranean-  style diet is about as good a diet as one can achieve for reducing 
cancer rates, but other diets rich in a variety of plant foods, such as the Okinawa diet, 
may also offer similar benefits to health and longevity.182 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Highlight: The major boost of Mediterranean diets is the increase in the num -
ber of servings of fruits and vegetables consumed each day, up to nine servings

other chronic  diseAses
Finally, several other chronic diseases are considered to be less likely to occur among 
those following a healthy Mediterranean-  style diet. These other diseases include 
hypertension, polycystic ovary disease, brain depression, macular degeneration, and 
osteoporosis. Better mental health and brain function may result from adherence to a 
Mediterranean way of eating. The detailed coverage of these conditions and diseases 
in Chapter 6 demonstrates that the attractive and healthful Mediterranean diets pro -
vide the balance of foods with the nutrients and phytochemicals needed to promote 
health and prevent or delay the serious life-  ending diseases so common today.

adherence to a Mediterranean-  style diet improved the health status of these partici -
pants, as shown by significant reductions in the incidence and devastating effects of 
several chronic diseases:
• 9% decline in overall mortality
• 9% decline in mortality from CVDs
• 6% decline in the incidence of and mortality from cancer
• 13% decline in the incidence of Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease
These impressive statistics suggest that a Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern is 
one important way to prevent and reduce the effect of the chronic diseases so preva -
lent in the United States and other nations.
longevity
The Mediterranean dietary pattern has been shown to prevent or reduce risks of 
many chronic debilitating diseases because the emphasis on plant foods plus a 
healthy lifestyle promote optimal functions of cells, tissues, and the various organ 
systems of the body. In turn, the health benefits of the Mediterranean dietary pattern 
prolong life, which translates to extended longevity trends among these populations.
Highlight: The health benefits of the Mediterranean dietary pattern prolong life, 
which translates to extended longevity trends among these populations.183 Eat Like a Mediterranean
Those populations having more physically active lives on a daily basis typically 
enjoy greater longevity. Following a healthful diet helps optimize the long-  term life 
expectancy of these populations. Regular cigarette smoking and high amounts of 
alcohol consumption tend to counterbalance physical activity and healthy diets. 
So, nations with populations that generally follow healthy lifestyles, such as the 
Mediterranean nations, tend to have greater longevity. Sardinia, for example, has 
the greatest life expectancy of almost any population of the world except Okinawa.
Data are not available for those who live in the coastal areas or near coastal 
areas, but rather for an entire nation that includes noncoastal peoples, which makes 
it difficult to obtain area-  specific statistics. Nevertheless, coastal populations of the 
Mediterranean region who consume fish, other seafood, olives and olive oil, veg -
etables, fruits, and more whole-  grain cereals do have greater longevity than those 
who do not follow this typical eating pattern.
CHANGES IN EATING PATTERNS: MOVING SLOWLY 
TOWARD TRADITIONAL MEDITERRANEAN DIETS
Much of our understanding of the health benefits of Mediterranean diets began in the 
1960s, at the time of the Seven Countries Study by Ancel Keys and his associates, 
but in the last couple of decades, the diets of these same nations have been gradu -
ally changing, and not always for the better. One potentially adverse change in the 
United States is the decline in consumption of fish, especially those with naturally 
occurring omega-3 fatty acids, at least in part because of the high cost of marine 
foods. Besides cost, another reason for reduced consumption of fish relates to con -
taminants that tend to be concentrated in some fish. Chapter  12  provides further 
information on contaminants in fish. Data on fish consumption by Mediterranean 
nations are not available, but intakes most likely have decreased somewhat over the 
last decade or two, as noted in a recent study from France. Other adverse changes 
include the increasingly large food portions served in many restaurants, the profu -
sion of more highly processed foods, and the increase in fast-  food consumption. 
Some fast-  food establishments, fortunately, are beginning to offer a few food and 
beverage choices that are more healthy along with their usual less-  healthy fare.
Some encouraging news, however, comes from recent dietary surveys in the 
United States, which indicated that eating patterns, in general, might be gradually 
moving toward a more Mediterranean-  style diet. Several of these beneficial trends 
are highlighted in the following:
• Increased consumption of whole grains
• Increased intake of vegetables
• Increased number of fruit servings
• Increased use of low-  fat foods
• Increased consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from foods
• Reduced intake of trans fats
• Reduced consumption of red meats
• Reduced consumption of high-  fat dairy foods
• Reduced use of sugar and sugar-  rich foods184 The Mediterranean Way of Eating
Highlight: Some encouraging news also comes from recent dietary surveys in 
the United States, which indicated that eating patterns, in general, may be gradu -
ally moving toward a more Mediterranean-  style diet.
Most of the healthy trends noted, however, need continuing improvement among 
the entire U.S. population to achieve an optimal eating pattern that provides signifi -
cant health benefits, as does a Mediterranean-  style dietary pattern.
HEALTHY VALUES TO AIM FOR BY MEDITERRANEAN 
DIET CONSUMERS
Table  18.2 lists healthy values of several clinical variables that consumers of 
Mediterranean dietary patterns should be able to achieve when coupled with reg -
ular physical activities, including walking and upper-  body exercises, and other 
healthy behaviors.
SUMMARY
The positive aspects of Mediterranean dietary patterns have been covered in previ -
ous chapters and compared to typical less-  healthy Western-  style eating patterns as 
found in much of the United States. The Mediterranean dietary patterns, despite dif -
ferences within various geographic regions, have been shown to provide the major 
health benefits reviewed in this book. Although many questions remain unresolved 
about the risk factors for the chronic diseases reviewed in Chapters 4 to 6, enough TABLE 18.2

information exists now to recommend a Mediterranean-  style eating pattern for prac -
tically everyone. Mediterranean dietary patterns have multiple functionalities (or 
positive effects on organ systems) in the promotion of healthful lives; in addition, 
several studies have shown that these healthy dietary patterns readily transfer to non- 
Mediterranean nations of the world.
Mediterranean diets rich in plant foods and fish, but not meats, have been reported 
in numerous research studies  to reduce risks for several common chronic diseases, 
including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, brain functional 
declines, eye problems, and osteoporosis. The disease-  preventing nutrients that pro -
vide these health benefits include antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and MFAs (olive 
oil). Plant-  derived chemicals or phytochemicals that also provide health benefits 
include phytosterols, polyphenols, dietary fiber (lignans and other components), and 
carotenoids (lycopenes and lutein). Additional polyphenols, found in red wines, also 
provide health benefits. Low-  fat dairy products that contain calcium and vitamin D 
may offer other possible benefits to health. Nations that traditionally have followed 
the plant-  based Mediterranean eating patterns also have low mortality rates, espe -
cially rates of ischemic heart disease and stroke.
Minimally processed foods, without dietary supplements, have traditionally been 
consumed as part of healthy plant-  based diets along with healthy lifestyles in the 
coastal regions of Mediterranean countries. A variety of healthy food choices from 
the different food groups, moderate portion sizes, healthy food preparation, less 
snacking, eating more slowly, spending a longer time at the main meal of the day, 
eating at home more often, and focusing on mindful eating all contribute to the goals 
we should be seeking: better health, more enjoyment from daily activities such as 
mealtimes, and greater life expectancy.
The entire lifestyle—diet, physical activity, and other healthy behaviors—runs 
the gamut throughout the world, but the Mediterranean peoples learned centuries 
ago how to balance these keystones of life so important in health promotion and dis -
ease prevention. It is hoped the information covered in this book will encourage and 
help you to move along a rewarding path to enjoyable and nutritious eating, improved 
health, and long life.187

Appendix A: Fiber Content 
of Foods in Common Portions
A high-  fiber diet can help lower cholesterol, control blood sugar (soluble fiber), and 
prevent constipation (insoluble fiber). Aim for 25–35 grams (g) of total fiber each day 
or 6–8 g per meal and 3–4 g per snack, choosing foods from all the categories listed 
here. Increase your fiber intake gradually, over 2 or 3 weeks, so your system can 
adapt to the added bulk without discomfort. Drink plenty of fluids, at least 6–8 cups 
of caffeine-  free liquid daily.

Appendix B: Recipes
Each of the following recipes contains important nutritional information to help you 
decide how a particular dish fits with any special dietary needs you might have. 
Nutritional analyses that accompany recipes may not always be 100% exact, but it is 
far better than having nothing and trying to guess the number of calories or amount 
of ingredients, such as sodium or saturated fat, contained in the stated serving size. 
A Nutrition Facts panel is on most packaged food labels and should be included with 
recipes as well.

Appendix E: Glossary 
of Terms Used in Text
Additives:  See Anthocyanins, Butylated hydroxyanisole, Butylated hydroxytoluene, 
Food additives, Nitrates, Nitrites
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) : See High-  energy bonds of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP)
Alcohol (ethanol):  A simple organic molecule that can be intoxicating; it is metabo -
lized by a two-  step process in many cells of the body, but especially in 
the liver; the metabolism of alcohol yields energy; alcohol has an Atwater 
energy equivalent of 7 kcal per gram.
Alpha-  linolenic acid (ALA):  An essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that 
may serve as a starting molecule for eicosanoid synthesis.
Amino acid:  The basic unit of proteins; both essential and nonessential amino acids 
needed.
Anthocyanins:  Plant pigments, especially red, often used as food additives, that 
may be absorbed; these natural coloring agents are considered safe.
Antioxidant:  A molecule that prevents the reaction between an oxygen free radi -
cal and macromolecules of cells (e.g.,  unsaturated fatty acids, proteins, 
and nucleic acids); antioxidant additives in food and many phytochemicals 
function as free radical quenchers in addition to antioxidant nutrients.
Apoproteins:  Specific proteins in lipoproteins that serve as recognition factors for 
receptors on cell surfaces, such as liver cells (hepatocytes) and fat cells 
(adipocytes).
Arteriosclerosis:  A more advanced lesion than atherosclerosis because of signifi -
cant mineralization and “hardening of arteries” so they do not retain nor -
mal elasticity.
Asian diet:  Diet characterized by high-  carbohydrate foods, such as rice and other 
grains, low amounts of animal foods, and good amounts of vegetables 
(greens) and fruits; commonly consumed in Japan, China, Korea, and other 
nations; diet typically contains limited amounts of many different food 
items per meal, including fish and other seafood; many vegetables; and pork 
that traditionally have been heavily salted, especially in Japan.
Atheroma:  A fatty deposit (or plaque) on the wall of an artery or arteriole formed 
as part of the atherosclerotic process; similar to a fatty streak but more 
defined; less advanced in development than an athersclerotic lesion that 
may have initiated some mineralization.
Atherosclerosis:  An early form of arterial pathology characterized by plaques or 
lipid accumulations (atheromas) in the arterial wall; any such lesion can 
become sufficiently extensive to interfere with or even to obstruct blood 
flow through the vessel, causing a clot (thrombus) to form at the site of 226 Appendix E: Glossary of Terms Used in Text
obstruction; plaques contain cholesterol, triglycerides, other fatty mol -
ecules, and tissue debris, including mineralization.
Atwater energy equivalents of macronutrients:  The energy equivalents per gram 
(g) of the macronutrients and alcohol (ethanol); for example, 1 g of carbo -
hydrate yields 4 kcal of energy; 1 g of fat yields 9 kcal; 1 g of protein yields 
4 kcal; and 1 g of alcohol (pure or 200 proof) yields 7 kcal.
Balanced diet:  A diet balanced with respect to macronutrients and micronutrients 
that provide all the essential nutrients and energy from foods in appropri -
ate amounts to support the daily activities of a healthy individual; essential 
requirements of all nutrients and nonnutrients are met by this type of diet, but 
energy and other intakes are not excessive, so that energy balance is main -
tained; such diets for healthy males and females contain intakes at approxi -
mately the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) levels.
Blood pressure:  A sphygmomanometer measurement of pressure in peripheral 
arteries when the heart is pumping (systolic) or at rest (diastolic). Values 
greater than normal are classified as hypertensive, normal values as normo -
tensive, low values as hypotensive.
Body composition:  The three-  compartment model of the body consists of 
the fat compartment, lean body mass exclusive of bone mineral mass 
(compartment 2), and the bone mass (compartment 3); other compartmental 
models that divide lean body mass into extracellular fluids (blood, cerebro -
spinal fluid, etc.) also exist.
Body mass index (BMI):  An estimation of body fat based on the equation of weight 
(kg)/height (m)² used to define overweight and obesity; body composition 
(i.e., fat mass) is more accurately measured by DXA. See Dual-  energy 
X- ray absorptiometry, Obesity, Overweight.
Bone balance:  Occurs during early adulthood (20 to 29 years) when bone resorption 
and bone formation remain practically equal; from then to about 40 years, 
resorption tends to exceed formation, and for women, resorption is much 
greater than formation from about 50 to 65 years; from 65, women and men 
lose bone mass at about the same rate. So, much of adult life is a time of 
negative bone balance, which increases the risk of fractures.
Bone health:  See Bone balance
Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA):  An antioxidant food additive used to retard ran -
cidity in fats and oils and in foods that contain oil. Based on limited animal 
studies, BHA may possibly be a carcinogen.
Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT):  An antioxidant food additive used to retard ran -
cidity in fats and oils and in foods that contain oil. BHT is considered a safe 
chemical additive until further testing proves otherwise.
Calcification:  Arteries calcify at numerous sites of the body and so do heart valves, 
typically where atheromas exist; the process increases with adult age. Coronary 
artery calcification is a risk factor for a heart attack and other cardiovas -
cular diseases. These inappropriate pathologic calcifications are similar to 
bone calcifications.
Calcium:  A major macromineral provided in dairy products and many plant foods.
Calories:  See Energy227 Appendix E: Glossary of Terms Used in Text
Cancer:  A disease of uncontrolled cell growth (proliferation); cancer cells do not con -
duct the normal functions characteristic of their cell type, but they do keep the 
general characteristics of their tissue of origin. Cancer cells exist in varying 
degrees of dedifferentiation; they may be contained within a capsule, but most 
cancer cells break away from their point of origin and metastasize to other 
tissues of the body. Diet-  related cancers have strong dietary determinants of 
the abnormal cell growth, especially cells of the colon, breast, and prostate. 
Excessive caloric intake may contribute to cancer causation.
Carbohydrate:  A class of macronutrient molecules containing carbon atoms linked 
to hydroxyl groups, with hydrogen having a ratio to oxygen of 2 to 1 in a 
molecule; dietary carbohydrates include sugars, starches, and nondigest -
ible dietary fibers; specific types are called monosaccharides, disaccha -
rides, and polysaccharides, including amylose, amylopectin, and glycogen. 
Glucose, a monosaccharide, is the circulating form in blood.
Carbon (C):  A chemical element studied in organic chemistry and biochemistry 
because so many of the molecules of living organisms have carbon atoms 
as part of their backbone.
Carbon–  hydrogen bond:  The chemical bond responsible for energy transfer to 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) within cells.
Carbon–oxygen bond:  The chemical linkage within key organic molecules of the body.
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs):  Diseases that develop from atherosclerosis in 
arteries and arterioles of the general circulatory system, including coro -
nary artery disease (heart disease), myocardial infarction (heart attack), 
angina, and stroke and transient ischemic attack (brain). Hypertension or 
high blood pressure is considered to be a separate disorder.
β- Carotene:  β- Carotene is a molecule with a yellow pigment that exists naturally 
in many plants, especially colored fruits and vegetables; β- carotene can 
be split into two vitamin A molecules by an enzyme located in the brush 
border surface of absorbing epithelial cells of the small intestine; this pro- 
vitamin A molecule, which has antioxidant properties, functions in a way 
distinctly different from vitamin A.
Carotenoids:  Plant molecules that typically have antioxidation functions; exam -
ples include β- carotene, lutein, lycopenes, and related molecules; only 
β- carotene serves as a major precursor of vitamin A.
Cholesterol:  A sterol molecule in membranes of animal cells; used as a precur -
sor for the synthesis of many different sterols (vitamin D) and steroids 
(estrogens and androgens); it is also synthesized by the liver and carried in 
blood by lipoproteins.
Chronic diseases:  The modern diseases that are diet related, including cardiovas -
cular diseases, obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and many cancers; 
diet- related chronic diseases largely have surpassed infectious diseases as 
the major causes of death.
Cis fatty acids:  The form of most naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids; the 
two hydrogen atoms around a double bond (C=C) are on the same side, as 
opposed to trans-  fatty acids. See also  Trans fat.228 Appendix E: Glossary of Terms Used in Text
Complementary proteins (diet):  The combining of two or more plant foods to 
provide the full complement of essential amino acids for the synthesis 
of proteins needed by the body; examples include pairing a grain and a 
legume, such as corn and beans (dried, not green beans); complementary 
protein foods do not have to be eaten in a single meal, but each food also 
can be eaten at different meals throughout the day and still provide all the 
essential amino acids.
Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score:  Also known as the Agatston score, this 
index serves to assess the mineralization of coronary arteries, part of the 
arteriosclerotic damage that reduces function of the arteries and increases 
the risk of CVD death.
Coronary artery disease:  See Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
DASH diet:  Dietary Approach to Stopping Hypertension (DASH) diet aids in the 
reduction of blood pressure; it also reduces other risk factors when carefully 
followed.
Diabetes mellitus:  See Type 2 diabetes
Dietary fiber:  A broad class of indigestible plant polysaccharides (by human enzymes) 
that is divided into water-  soluble and water-  insoluble subclasses; solubility 
depends largely on the molecular size of the specific fiber molecule; the small 
molecules tend to be soluble in water, whereas the larger ones are not.
Dietary pattern:  The typical pattern of eating within a society or culture; for exam -
ple, in the United States and many Western nations, traditional meals have 
contained one or more servings of red meat plus dairy products, breads, 
potatoes, beans, or one other vegetable. The Mediterranean region has sev -
eral types of dietary patterns; Asian nations such as Japan have still different 
patterns; alternate dietary patterns, including various forms of vegetarian -
ism, have greatly modified the traditional approach to eating.
Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs):  Recommended amounts of intake for each 
nutrient across the life cycle. Most nutrients have Recommended Dietary 
Allowances (RDAs) because an Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) has 
been reasonably established at each stage of the life cycle, but a few nutri -
ents have Adequate Intakes (AIs) because average requirements have not 
been established. Upper limits (ULs) of safety have also been established 
for each nutrient beyond which deleterious effects and toxicity may occur.
Diet-  related cancers:  See Cancer
Digestive tract:  See Gastrointestinal tract
Distribution (%) of macronutrients in the diet:  The usual diet is split into per -
centages of the three energy-  providing macronutrients (i.e., carbohydrate, 
fat, and protein); alcohol usually provides so few kilocalories that they are 
not included in the percentage distribution. For example, in the United 
States carbohydrates represent about 50–55% of the total dietary energy 
consumed in one day (24 hours), fat 30–35%, and protein 15–20%.
Dual-  energy X-  ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA):  A device or machine that 
scans bone and soft tissues of the body through the use of two energy 
sources of X-  rays for separate measurements of bone and adipose tissue 229 Appendix E: Glossary of Terms Used in Text
(fat); the total body scan permits estimations of mass of bone, fat, and 
by difference, lean body mass (primarily muscle) where total body mass 
(weight) is known; bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density 
(BMD) are measured by this instrument; see also  Body composition, Body 
mass index.
Eating pattern:  See Dietary Pattern
Eicosanoids:  The general name of certain lipid molecules derived from 20-carbon 
(eicosa-) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFAs), such as arachidonic acid (an 
omega-6 fatty acid) found in many vegetable oils, and eicosapentaenoic acid 
(an omega-3 fatty acid) found in fish oils and some other foods; the many 
sub- families include the prostaglandins, the thromboxanes, and the leuko -
trienes, each having different health effects.
Endothelial cells:  Flat cells, in sheaths, that line blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, 
and other tubes and cavities of the body.
Energy:  A physical unit expressed as calories, kilocalories (kcal), or joules that 
is derived from food macronutrients and alcohol; 1 kcal = the amount of 
heat required to raise the temperature of a gram of water 1° centigrade (C); 
1 kcal equals 1,000 calories (lowercase “c”), which is equivalent to 1 Calorie 
(uppercase C); the “little c” often is incorrectly used, as in the nutritional 
data accompanying most recipes.
Essential amino acid:  Essential (or indispensable) amino acids that must be sup -
plied in the diet because humans do not have enzymes that can synthesize 
them, as opposed to nonessential amino acids. The organic keto acid por -
tion of essential amino acids is really what is essential in these amino acids, 
which means that they are only available in the amounts required from 
foods, both plant and animal sources. Animal foods generally contain all 
the essential amino acids compared to most plant foods, which lack one or 
more amino acids. Thus, the protein in a single animal food is of a higher 
quality than in most single-  plant foods. See Complementary protein.
Essential fatty acid:  Only a few polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFAs) are essential, 
including linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6 or omega-6 series) and alpha-  linolenic acid 
(C18:3 n-3 or omega-3 series); also others, including arachidonic acid and a 
few other PFAs of 20 carbons or longer, are considered essential because 
these longer PFAs are required for the synthesis of eicosanoids; all other 
fatty acids, such as the saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, are con -
sidered nonessential; humans only have enzymes that can elongate linoleic 
and other lengthy PFAs into the even longer eicosanoids, such as prosta -
glandins, with still greater numbers of double bonds. See Eicosanoids, 
Omega-3 PFAs, Omega-6 PFAs.
Ethanol:  See Alcohol
Fasting blood glucose test:  Measurement of blood glucose in a person after an 
overnight fast of at least 8 hours; used to detect diabetes and prediabetes. 
See Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
Fasting blood (serum) lipids:  Measurement of lipoproteins and triglycerides (fats) 
as part of a lipid panel for assessing risk of heart disease.230 Appendix E: Glossary of Terms Used in Text
Fat: One type of lipid molecule, also known as triglycerides, that contains one glyc -
erol and three fatty acids; fats exist as solids (animal) or liquids (plant oils), 
depending on their composition of fatty acids; fats exist in adipose tissue 
throughout the body, as well as in skeletal muscle tissue.
Fat- soluble vitamins:  See Vitamins
Fatty acid (FA):  A class of lipids that contains a hydrocarbon chain and a carboxyl 
(COOH) group at one end; these molecules can be fully saturated or partly 
unsaturated. Typically, they are obtained in the diet in triglycerides (also called 
triacylglycerol) or phospholipids; fatty acids range in length from 10 to 22 car -
bon atoms; unsaturation exists when a double bond (C=C) exists in the hydro -
carbon chain (i.e., monounsaturation); polyunsaturation occurs when two or 
more double bonds exist. Long-  chain polyunsaturated fatty acids include lin -
oleic acid, alpha-  linolenic acid, and others used to make eicosanoids.
Fiber:  See Dietary fiber

ing, peeling, cutting, cooking, and other steps; culinary skills are used in 
making foods both tasty and visually appealing as well as in maximizing 
their health benefits.
Food processing:  The modification of a food in various physical or chemical ways 
so that the food product may appear quite different from the original prod -
uct; often, some nutrients are lost in processing, such as in the extraction of 
wheat to white flour. Processing often includes the introduction of additives 
of various types, including nutrients and a variety of chemical molecules.
Fortification of foods:  Adding nutrients to food products that were not present in 
the original products or increasing the amounts of one or more nutrients 
that were originally present to improve intakes of less-  consumed essential 
nutrients, such as calcium-  fortified orange juice, folic acid–  fortified flour, 
iron-  fortified cereals, and vitamin D–  fortified milk.
Free radical:  A highly reactive chemical species (of very short life); free radicals 
are typically oxygen atoms containing a free electron that combine with a 
carbon atom of an unsaturated fatty acid (at the site of a double bond) or of 
other molecules, including proteins and DNA; the result is the splitting 
of the original molecule into two at the point of attack (i.e., the unsaturated 
bond); damage to DNA may result in mutations. Free radicals are typically 
scavenged in cells by protective antioxidant molecules that can take on or 
quench the free radicals without further damage to the large molecules of 
cells. See Antioxidant, Oxidation.
Gastrointestinal (GI) tract:  The alimentary tract, or gut, is part of an organ system 
that consists of the tube that runs from the mouth to the anus and the associ -
ated organs, such as the salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and glands along 
the mucosal lining of the tube itself. Although fluids in the lumen of the 
gut are technically part of the external environment, they are significantly 
modified by secretions of the various glands.231 Appendix E: Glossary of Terms Used in Text
Genetically modified foods:  Foods harvested from genetically modified organisms 
(GMOs) that have their genetic codes (DNA) modified by modern techniques.

for cellular functions. Glucose has many uses, but most of it is converted to 
ATP or cellular energy. See Carbohydrate, High-  energy bonds of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP).
Glycemic index:  The increase in blood glucose concentration following ingestion, 
digestion, and absorption of food or a specific food item, such as sugar or 
starch. The total amount of readily digestible carbohydrate is referred to as 
the glucose load, and the combination of glucose load and rapid entry of 
glucose to blood generates a high blood glucose concentration that requires 
the action of insulin to move it into cells, especially muscle and fat cells.
Glycemic load:  An accumulation of the amounts of all the foods generating glucose in 
a single meal. Dietary fiber is not included in the total glucose load of a meal.
Glycerol:  A three-  carbon alcohol molecule that is a component of triglycerides or 
fats; it is needed for synthesis of a fat molecule, and when a fat molecule 
is enzymatically degraded in the body, glycerol is released (i.e., free) for 
further metabolic use.
Healthy diet:  A diet containing all the essential nutrients and sufficient energy plus 
the plant molecules or phytochemicals that support growth and maintain 
tissues in later life.
Heart attack:  See Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)

double bonds (C=C) of unsaturated fatty acids to generate trans-  fatty acids 
(i.e., trans fat).
Hyperglycemia:  Significantly elevated fasting blood concentration of glucose 
(i.e., beyond the range of normality); hyperglycemia is typically related 
to abnormal glucose tolerance, glycosuria (urinary glucose), hyperinsu -
linemia, and diabetes mellitus.
Hypertension:  Also known as high blood pressure, this abnormal measurement 
reflects deleterious changes in either the peripheral vessels or the heart, as 
measured by cardiac output of blood per beat.
Immune defense:  The production of immunoglobulins and cytokines as well as the 
activation of diverse cells (lymphocytes and others) of the immune system 
in response to an antigen or foreign agents, including micro  organ  isms, such 
as bacteria and viruses.
Insulin:  A hormone, produced by B or beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the 
pancreas, that acts on many cells of the body, especially in muscle and fat 
tissues, to permit glucose entry into these cells from blood and extracellular 
fluids, especially during the postprandial (after meal) period; insulin also 
has other functions.232 Appendix E: Glossary of Terms Used in Text
Insulin resistance (syndrome):  See Peripheral resistance to insulin
Iron:  An essential trace element provided by meats and legumes in good amounts; 
a major fortificant added to cereal flours; two dietary forms are heme iron

Kilocalories:  See Energy
Lactose intolerance:  The inability of some individuals to digest lactose (sugar) in 
milk, resulting in cramping and discomfort in the belly.
Life expectancy:  The lifetime age, measured at birth, of men and women; in the 
United States, men and women of all races born in 2010 have a life expec -
tancy of approximately 81 years for females and 76 years for males; longev -
ity and life span are similar terms.
Lifestyle factor:  A variable that may influence health positively or negatively; a col -
lection of behaviors; for example, cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol 
consumption are deleterious factors, whereas regular physical activity and 
a nutritious, balanced diet are beneficial factors for health.

ids, cholesterol, sterols, steroids, eicosanoids, prostaglandins, waxes, fat-  soluble 
vitamins, phytomolecules (except for dietary fiber), and other molecules.
Lipoprotein:  A complex aggregate of protein and lipid molecules, or a particle, that 
contains specific apoproteins and three main types of lipids: triglycerides, 
cholesterol-  esters, and phospholipids. Lipoproteins are special lipid trans -
port vehicles in the blood that deliver their contents to tissues; lipoproteins 
are typically synthesized by the epithelial absorbing cells of the GI tract 
(chylomicrons) and by liver cells, very low-  density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and 
high-  density lipoproteins (HDLs). VLDLs and chylomicron lipoproteins are 
partially degraded in peripheral capillaries through the action of enzymes, and 
the modified low-  density lipoproteins (LDLs) are taken up (cleared) totally by 
liver cells, each having a typical half-  life in the circulation. LDL clearance, 
however, is slow, and the LDL cholesterol concentration can increase greatly 
if not treated.
Long-  chain fatty acid:  See Fatty acid (FA)
Macrominerals:  Also known as bulk minerals because they are needed in larger 
quantities each day than microminerals or trace elements; the mineral ele -
ments needed in large amounts in the diet each day include calcium, phos -
phorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, and often sulfur. See 
Microminerals.
Macronutrients:  Class of nutrients that generate energy (carbohydrates, fats, pro -
teins) and provide nitrogen (N) and amino acids (protein). Sometimes other 
molecules, such as cholesterol and dietary fiber, are included in this class 
because they are consumed in large amounts.233 Appendix E: Glossary of Terms Used in Text

also known as syndrome X and the insulin-  resistant syndrome. Obesity 
is one of the main risk factors.
Microminerals (trace elements):  Minerals, typically charged as a cation or anion, 
needed in small quantities in the diet each day; approximately 10 trace ele -
ments are considered essential for humankind, but a few others may be classi -

often adjusted for specific factors, such as age of the population.
Myocardial infarction:  See Cardiovascular diseases
Negative balance:  A diet no longer balanced with respect to macronutrients and 
micronutrients that provides all the essential nutrients and energy from 
foods to support the daily activities of a healthy individual; a negative bal -
ance of energy or protein has significant effects on growth and, to a lesser 
extent, on maintenance during adulthood. Single micronutrient deficits may 
also have adverse effects, such as inadequate vitamin D that causes rickets 
in children or osteomalacia in adults.
Nitrates:  A nitrogen-  containing food additive used in the curing of meats, hot 
dogs, and luncheon meats that inhibits bacterial growth; nitrates may 
combine with amines and be converted to nitrosoamines, which are 
potential carcinogens.
Nitrite:  A nitrogen-  containing food additive used to cure meats and meat products, 
especially ham, bacon, frankfurters, and related products; similar to nitrate 
in its usage as an additive. It can combine with the amines of meat proteins 
to form nitrosamines, potential carcinogens.
Nitrogen (N):  An element used in amino acids, nucleic acids, and numerous other 
organic molecules; nitrogen typically exists in the form of an amine group 
(–NH2) in these molecules; two atoms of nitrogen, as part of amine groups, 
are used to synthesize urea.
Nitrosamine:  A complex molecule resulting from the combination of a nitrate or 
nitrite with a protein in foods or tissues; in meats, the combination of nitrite 
with the secondary amine groups of myoglobin or other muscle proteins 
results in potentially carcinogenic nitrosamines.

sues and are the basis of our macronutrients in foods and alcohol.
Osteopenia:  Having a bone mineral density (BMD) less than normal; over time 
may lead to osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis:  Excessive loss of bone tissue, mass, and strength beyond osteopenia 
increases the risk of fractures, especially hip fractures. Measurement of 
bone mineral density by DXA classifies individuals as normal, osteopenic, 
or osteoporotic. See Dual-  energy X-  ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA).
Overnutrition:  Excessive food energy consumption that leads to overweight and 
obesity when chronic.
Overweight:  A body weight above the normal range and having a BMI between 
25.0 and 29.9. Overweight is not the same as obesity, but it also reflects 
excessive gain of body fat.
Oxidation:  The breaking of a bond in a large macromolecule within cells, such 
as by free radicals, which is protected against by antioxidants in a cell at 
the same time; also, the complete combustion of an organic molecule in the 
presence of oxygen, which forms carbon dioxide, metabolic water, and heat.
Oxygen (O):  An atom of great importance to the synthesis of cell molecules; oxy -
gen as a gas exists as O2, consisting of two atoms of oxygen.
Peripheral resistance to insulin:  Resistance of peripheral tissues (e.g., muscle and 
adipose [fat]) to the action of insulin. Obesity is associated with insulin 
resistance, and as body fat increases insulin resistance also increases. It is a 
condition typically leading to prediabetes and progressing to type 2 diabe -
tes mellitus if weight is not managed.
Phosphorus (P):  This element exists in biological tissues and fluids as a phosphate 
ion; phosphates are used in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 
nucleic acids (DNA, RNA), and many important molecules used in cellular 
metabolism; inorganic phosphate ions are used also in formation of bone 
crystals that give hardness to the skeleton.
Phytoalexins:  Plant molecules that are used to ward off insect pests or other attack -
ing organisms because these molecules taste bad or cause damage to the other 
organism.235 Appendix E: Glossary of Terms Used in Text
Phytochemicals:  See Phytomolecules (phytochemicals)
Phytomolecules (phytochemicals):  Nonnutrient molecules made by plants and 
found in diverse fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds; many of these 
molecules are considered to help protect against cancer development and 
other chronic diseases. A great variety of phytomolecules have functions in 
the plant, but when consumed by humans they may have beneficial effects, 
most notably acting as antioxidants following intestinal absorption.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFAs or PUFAs):  See Essential fatty acid, Fatty 
acid (FA)
Postprandial (noun form:  postprandium):  The period after ingesting a meal when 
much of the digestion and absorption of the macronutrients occurs and the 
blood glucose concentration rises significantly.
Processed food:  See Food processing
Prostaglandins:  See Eicosanoids
Protein:  A macronutrient class made as a polymer of amino acids, typically more 
than 100 amino acids; proteins have several types of three-  dimensional struc -
tures that permit diverse functional capabilities; they also contribute nitrogen 
(N) for synthesis of other molecules. High-  quality protein, typically of ani -
mal origin, includes all essential amino acids. See Essential amino acid.
Quenching of free radicals:  See Free radical
Ratio of omega-6 PFAs to omega-3 PFAs:  The ratio of these two types of PFAs is 
thought to be healthy at less than 10 to 1 (10:1), perhaps as low as 4:1, but the 
optimal ratio has not yet been established.
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs):  See Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)

Supplements:  Purified micronutrients in pill form; nutrients consumed through 
the ingestion of pills or tablets for the purpose of improving nutritional 
status. Typically, micronutrients are taken as supplements, but protein 
and energy macronutrients may also be increased by specific fat or car -
bohydrate supplements, typically as nutritional drinks; supplements are 
distinguished from nutrient fortificants (i.e., nutrients added to foods).
Trace elements:  See Microminerals
Trans fat (or trans-  fatty acids):  A modified fat produced in the processing of 
unsaturated fats (PFAs or MFAs); hydrogen is added to a liquid vegetable 
oil to make a partially hydrogenated solid fat, which removes typically one 236 Appendix E: Glossary of Terms Used in Text
double bond (C=C), reducing it to a single bond (C–  C) plus modifying the 
remaining double bond from the cis position to the trans  position; the trans- 
fatty acids in the newly generated trans fat are deleterious because they 
increase the risk of chronic diseases.
Triacylglycerol:  See Fat, Fatty acid (FA)
Triglyceride (TG):  See Fat, Fatty acid (FA)
Type 2 diabetes:  One type of diabetes mellitus that is closely associated with 
overweight/  obesity. Abnormal control of blood glucose typically results 
from reduced uptake of glucose from the blood into muscle and fat cells.
Undernutrition:  Condition of too little energy intake from foods (and usually 
micronutrients as well) and when chronic, increases the risk of mortality.
Unsaturated fatty acids:  See Fatty acid (FA)
Vegan diet:  A diet containing only plant foods; also known as a strict vegetarian diet.

a strict vegetarian diet is a vegan diet and contains no animal products; other 
vegetarian diets may include milk (lacto-  vegetarian), eggs (ovo-  vegetarian), 
milk and eggs (lacto-  ovo- vegetarian), or fish (pesco-  vegetarian).
Vitamin D:  Vitamin obtained from the diet or skin biosynthesis that is converted in 
the body to a circulating metabolite (storage form) that is modified to a vita -
min D hormone that has important roles in calcium absorption and metabo -
lism and on practically all other tissues of the body as a general hormone.
Vitamins:  Water-  soluble vitamins and fat-  soluble vitamins required by the body for 
optimal health from plant and animal foods and sometimes supplements; 
organic micronutrients needed in the diet in small amounts on a daily or 
almost daily basis. Water-  soluble vitamins consist of the B vitamins and 
vitamin C (ascorbic acid), whereas the fat-  soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and 
K. Vitamin D may also be directly synthesized by exposed skin under UVB 
light. See β- Carotene, Carotenoids.
Waist measurement:  Serves as a prognostic index of health; a large waist circum -
ference is typical of the android distribution of fat more common in males, 
and it is associated with more metabolically active fat tissue of the abdomi -
nal cavity that increases risk of many chronic diseases.
Water- insoluble vitamins (fat soluble):  See Vitamins
Water-  soluble vitamins:  See Vitamins
Weight control:  Excessive calories with limited physical activity contribute to 
overweight/  obesity, whereas lesser caloric intake and regular exercise help 
in the maintenance of a healthy weight.

Zinc:  An essential trace element provided by meats and many plant foods.www.crcpress.comThe Mediterranean Way of EatingNutrition
Scientific evidence accumulated over decades validates the idea that a plant-based 
dietary pattern, such as the traditional Mediterranean way of eating, promotes 
health and plays an important role in risk reduction and prevention of several 
chronic diseases. One of the great advantages of the Mediterranean diet is that it 
can be easily adopted by other cultures because it is flexible and highly palatable. 
The Mediterranean Way of Eating: Evidence for Chronic Disease Prevention 
and Weight Management offers evidence-based information about an enjoyable, 
healthy way of eating that has stood the test of time, along with practical suggestions 
for incorporating the Mediterranean diet into your daily life.
The first part of the book provides a brief history of the Mediterranean region and 
its different dietary influences. It discusses shared and unique foods in the coastal 
regions, and recent influences of processed foods and fast foods. It also presents 
scientific information on critical nutrients (macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, 
phytochemicals, antioxidants, and fiber) in foods found in the Mediterranean 
diets, how they function in the body, and why they are essential to health. The 
authors review the major chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, 
cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers, and examine how a Mediterranean-
style diet may help reduce risk or prevent these diseases.
The second part of the book addresses the protective effects of foods and food 
components, discussing how Mediterranean diets may confer health benefits for 
reducing disease risk and managing weight. It examines the evidence-based health 
benefits for each of the food groups—such as fruits, vegetables, grains, fish, meat, 
dairy products, plus alcohol—along with suggestions for using the foods as part 
of a healthy diet. The last part of the book focuses on how to move toward a 
Mediterranean-style diet in your own life, eating at home or dining out, offering 
effective strategies for implementing the dietary changes.
