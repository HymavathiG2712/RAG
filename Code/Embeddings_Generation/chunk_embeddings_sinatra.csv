Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in
Cardiovascular MedicineNutritional and Integrative Strategies
in Cardiovascular MedicineDespite 40 years of aggressive pharmaceutical and surgical interventions, coronary artery disease
(CAD) remains the number one killer of women and men in Western civilization.

When it comes to CAD, prevention is easier than cure, and if CAD does present itself, a combination of conventional and alternative methodologies can truly make a difference in people’s lives.

Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine  provides scientific and clinical insight
from leaders in the field of cardiovascular medicine who explore an integrative approach to treating and curing cardiovascular diseases through conventional and non-allopathic methodologies.

Nutritional interventions with both appropriate noninflammatory diets and targeted nutraceutical
supports are simple and basic strategies to prevent as well as help manage CAD and congestive heart failure (CHF).

This evidence-based book describes how to integrate nutrition, supplements, lifestyle changes, and medications for improved outcomes in hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and much more.

Topics include
• Nutrigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in heart disease
• The risks and side effects of statin drugs
• The value of omega-3s and other fats
• Naturopathic approaches
• Gender-specific medicine
• Nutrient-drug interactions in cardiovascular medicine
Nutritional medicine and understanding nutrigenomics for the prevention and treatment of
cardiovascular disease will become the recommended practice of medicine in the very near future.

This book is designed to help established health professionals as well as students preparing for degrees in healthcare.

Introduction
Stephen T. Sinatra
It gives me great pleasure to offer Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
as an in-depth communication offering vital information in the diagnosis and management of ath -
erosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Despite 40 years of aggressive pharmaceutical and surgical
interventions,1 coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the number one killer of women and men in
Western  civilization.

Although urgent use of percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PCI) can
be lifesaving in acute myocardial infarction, the elective use of these procedures offers minimal
protection from future cardiovascular events or even longevity.2 Clearly, when it comes to CAD,
“prevention is easier than cure” and if CAD does present itself, a combination of conventional and
alternative methodologies can truly make a difference in people’s lives.

Nutritional interventions
with both appropriate noninflammatory diets and targeted nutraceutical supports are simple and
basic strategies to prevent as well as help manage CAD.

In an ideal world, we would eat all the nutrients necessary to sustain and protect our health.

In
reality, however, most of us do not eat a nutritious diet full of fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, and
lean protein.

Instead, we too frequently eat on the basis of convenience and price, and that means
more processed foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients.

Instead, we too frequently eat on the basis of convenience and price, and that means
more processed foods that are high in calories and low in nutrients.

Even if we do manage to eat healthy foods most of the time, our diets probably do not contain
therapeutic amounts of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals necessary to help prevent cancer, car -
diovascular disease, and other degenerative diseases, and which contribute to premature aging.

Behind these conditions is inflammation.

And what drives inflammation are out-of-control free
radicals, molecular fragments produced by natural metabolism, foods, transfats, sugar, environmen -
tal toxins, and radiation, to mention a few.

As our bodies contain limited amounts of enzymes that
neutralize free radicals, we need to look for antioxidants from outside sources.

Today, we realize that vast numbers of people eat poorly and do not get proper nutrition from
their diets that their bodies need to sustain good health.

Moreover, a global wave of revealing
nutritional research has rendered the conventional viewpoint on supplementation utterly obsolete.

Hundreds of published studies have shown that individual nutrients at doses higher than those usu -
ally present in food have a significant preventive and therapeutic effect on one’s health.

Targeted nutraceuticals are not a substitute for good nutrition, but they provide the kind of sup -
port that can help prevent inflammatory damage and boost energy production in the body.

Knowing
which nutrients are best for you individually, as well as in what amounts, can help you nurture your -
self appropriately.

For example, supplementing with nutrients designed to facilitate and stimulate
energy substrate production is the basis of metabolic cardiology.

The combination of targeted supplements and a healthy diet has been the cornerstone of the
nutritional strategy that I applied for decades to help my patients with heart disease and many other
maladies.

I used this approach therapeutically as well as preventively to heal and create optimum
health.

Most doctors today prescribe drugs for specific effects, such as lowering cholesterol, blood
pressure, and blood sugar.

When pharmaceutical drugs do not work in restoring blood flow, surgeons may be called in to
perform lifesaving bypasses or heart transplants.

In integrative medicine, we use or recommend
these methods as well.

But we have learned to do something extra, something normally ignored,
absolutely simplistic, and bargain-basement cheap compared to dazzling, big-ticket technol -
ogy.

We optimize your nutritional status with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other natural
substances—by doing that we optimize your healing and health.

In the fight against disease, we viii Introduction
do not fight the enemy with limited weapons.

We use many.

We use what works best, whether the
weapons are conventional, natural, or complementary.

Before 1990, vitamins and minerals were seen by most physicians as substances in food that
prevented nutritional deficiency states such as scurvy, beriberi, rickets, and pellagra.

Mainstream
medicine viewed supplementation as unnecessary because, supposedly, “we get all the nutrition we
need from our diet.” For decades, only a small minority of nutritionally oriented physicians recom -
mended supplements for serious diseases and not just for serious deficiency states.

The wealth of research has greatly influenced the way I perceive healing.

A comprehensive tar -
geted nutritional supplement program in combination with a noninflammatory diet is a major part
of a preventive and therapeutic intervention.

The supplements address specific cardiovascular short -
comings and simultaneously strengthen overall physiology to thwart off infection, inflammation,
and plaque while attenuating oxidative lipid issues and blood pressure problems.

Sick people need this nutritional upgrade.

They benefit magnificently.

Sick people need this nutritional upgrade.

They benefit magnificently.

It often keeps them out
of the hospital.

Sometimes supplements work rapidly like magic.

Patients suddenly become rejuve -
nated as their nutritionally starved bodies respond to healing nutrients that were missing for years.

Other times, we see a steady but remarkable return to health by patients who previously sputtered
along on near-empty tanks.

Now, with their tanks full, they move actively forward in life, feeling
better than they have felt in years.

In this book, a list of talented authors offers discussions and therapeutic options highlighting
their expertise in cardiovascular disease.

An in-depth evaluation of fats and lipids as well as alterna -
tive and integrative options are offered in the management of lipid disorders and high blood pres -
sure.

Other than cigarette smoking, hypertension remains the second most significant risk factor in
both men and women.

The management of hypertension with diet and targeted nutritional supports
is thoroughly presented by several authors.

Detoxification, Lyme disease (a serious microbe threat
to the heart), and the enormous importance of dental considerations are presented to the reader.

The discussion on metabolic syndrome is extremely timely given the fact that this inflammatory
metabolic problem is affecting millions of our youth.

A naturopathic approach to cardiovascular
disease highlighting the value of detoxification is introduced in the care and the management of
cardiovascular patients.

Hormonal bioidentical interventions and the special concerns of heart dis -
ease in women are highlighted with a gender-specific focus.

The impact of emotional stress on the
heart and the poorly understood association regarding pharmaceutical drugs’ influence on nutrient
depletion are also presented.

Multiple authors have their own way of telling their stories while offering valuable informa -
tion.

Some of the chapters are conversational, others are like reading a scientific journal, and
still others reflect personal observations in the care of their patients.

Multiple styles of writing
offer the reader creative ways of assimilating the information.

Although you may find some
duplication of the content, the reader is offered multiple choices in the search for treatments and
solutions.

This textbook was designed to help health professionals utilize natural healing foods, as well as
nutritional supports and other valuable interventions in the battle against cardiovascular disease.

This book was written for doctors who want to know about the most leading and cutting-edge
integrative advances that will benefit their patients.

In the final analysis, we physicians and health
professionals want to reduce the suffering of our patients while extending quality of life at the
same time.

The contents of Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine  are
a  testimony to the integrative care of the patient.

I want to thank all the authors for their hard work and contribution to the subject matter and
especially Dr. Mark Houston for assisting me with the editing process.

I would also like to thank
the American College of Nutrition for their willingness to review this book and place their seal of
approval on its contents.ix Introduction

1Myths of Cholesterol
Rethinking a Paradigm
Jonny Bowden and Stephen T. Sinatra
In this opening chapter, we will present the case for a reevaluation of some of the most widely held
beliefs about cholesterol and saturated fat.

We will argue that the cholesterol hypothesis—at least
the version that most people continue to cling to—is seriously flawed and deserves a reassessment.

We believe that a thorough examination of the mechanisms by which cholesterol is presumed to
cause heart disease is long overdue and that an objective reexamination of the evidence will reveal
that cholesterol is being wrongly blamed for crimes that it does not—and never did—  commit.

Cholesterol is found at the scene of the crime, but it is not the perpetrator, and may well turn out to
be a marker for other variables.

Blaming cholesterol for plaque and heart disease is a bit like blam -
ing the St. Bernard for the avalanche.

And, despite massive efforts by the Big Pharma  to convince
us otherwise, the evidence for cholesterol lowering as an effective strategy for preventing or reduc -
ing heart disease is actually pretty flimsy.

In 2012, the two of us came together to write a book, The Great Cholesterol Myth , the purpose
of which was to educate the public about what really causes heart disease and to suggest some prac -
tical and effective tips for reducing risk above and beyond the rather myopic focus on cholesterol
numbers.

The reaction to the book was somewhat unprecedented.

The reaction to the book was somewhat unprecedented.

Although it garnered hundreds
of glowingly positive reviews on Amazon (many of them from physicians) and spent 6 months in
the number one slot in the heart disease category, it also generated enough vitriol and anger from
some members of the medical establishment to suggest that the subject of cholesterol has become
extremely polarized and sclerotic.

The hysteria generated by the book—indeed, by all books that
have questioned cholesterol orthodoxy *—suggests that it might be time to take a step back and
reexamine the evidence.

The great nutritionist, Robert Crayhon, once famously said that there are
two problems with nutrition: thinking that it cannot do anything  and thinking that it can do every -
thing .

The exact same words could be said about cholesterol.

For decades, we—doctors and patients alike—collectively believed that cholesterol was the most
important marker for cardiovascular risk, and billions of dollars have been spent bolstering that
notion and developing and promoting treatments based on it.

Our collective, single-minded focus on
lowering cholesterol has several consequences, none of them good.

It has caused us to pay relatively
less attention to likely promoters of heart disease such as sugar, oxidative damage, inflammation,
and emotional stress.

* The Cholesterol Myths: Exposing the Fallacy that Saturated Fat and Cholesterol Cause Heart Disease  by Swedish
researcher Uffe Ravnskov, MD, PhD, was one of the first books to seriously and scientifically question the cholesterol
paradigm—it was literally burned on television in Finland in 1992.CONTENTS

The demonization of cholesterol has also resulted in a corresponding (and unjustified) demoni -
zation of saturated fat in the diet.

As we will see, a considerable body of emerging research shows
no linkage between dietary saturated fat and heart disease.

The wrongful indictment of fat—and
saturated fat in particular—led to dietary recommendations that we believe deserve a big part of the
blame for the current epidemics in diabetes and obesity.1
It has also resulted in a vast amount of overprescribing for cholesterol-lowering drugs to patients
that may not need them, and may even, in many cases, be harmed by them—all at an enormous cost.

Although we remain “cholesterol skeptics,” our view is not quite as extreme as some critics have
suggested.

It can be summed up as follows:
1.

Cholesterol is a player  in heart disease, but not in the way (nor to the extent) that is widely
believed.

2.

The standard cholesterol test—given as part of a standard sequential multiple analysis
computer (SMAC) profile—is out of date and obsolete.

We are measuring cholesterol in
the crudest of ways, and are not looking at the data that could actually provide useful infor -
mation about risk and treatment (i.e., particle number , particle size and pattern, Lp[a], apoB
[apolipoprotein, a lipid marker of very low density lipoprotein and low density  lipoprotein
[LDL]; when elevated, considered a marker of inflammation]).

3.

According to the discussion in point 2, we are treating many people who are not at risk
with powerful drugs (purely on the basis of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]
numbers), and we are missing many people who are at risk.

4.

The dietary recommendations we have been given for the past 40 years, based largely on
the fear of cholesterol and saturated fat, are out of date and counterproductive.

Saturated
fat does not cause heart disease, and its effect on cholesterol is far more nuanced than we
have been led to believe.

Meanwhile, the very foods that have been directly or indirectly
recommended to us for so many years as replacements for the saturated fat—margarine,
cereal, pasta, bread, potatoes, refined vegetable oils, and many grain products—actually
contribute to heart disease (as well as obesity and diabetes) in a number of insidious ways.

5.

Regarding heart disease, the true demon in the diet is not—and never has been—fat.

It is sugar .

6.

Cholesterol in the blood never becomes a problem until it is oxidized.

7.

Our efforts at prevention should focus on reducing oxidation, inflammation, and stress—
three major promoters of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

8.

Statin drugs are being widely overprescribed, particularly in situations where the evidence
for benefit is slim to none (primary prevention), populations where there is not sufficient
evidence that they do much good (women, the elderly) and populations in which there is
reasonable evidence that they may be doing great harm (children).

9.

The significant side effects of these expensive and overprescribed drugs are hugely under -
reported and underpublicized.

People are being prescribed powerful medicines that they
believe will extend their lives, oblivious of the fact that research shows clearly that they do
no such thing.

(We will discuss points 8 and 9 in Chapter 3.)

IN SEARCH OF A NEW PARADIGM
In philosophy 101, we learn of “the black swan theory”—an unexpected event that appears to be an
exception to a widely accepted rule (all swans are white) causing a reevaluation of the original rule,
and often a rationalization that allows the believer to hold on to the original hypothesis (i.e., “it had
to be a white swan that flew into some paint”).

The problem with the belief that cholesterol is the main player in heart disease is that there is not
just one black swan exception, there are many.

More than a few studies have shown little relationship 3 Myths of Cholesterol
between cholesterol and heart disease.

In the Lyon Diet Heart Study,2 the intervention group experi -
enced a 70% reduction in all-cause mortality without any change in their cholesterol levels.

A 1994
study published in JAMA  found no association between cholesterol and coronary heart disease mor -
tality and morbidity and all-cause mortality in persons older than 70.3 The Framingham study, which
as of this writing, is on its third generation of participants, did demonstrate an inverse relationship
between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and coronary heart disease (CHD), as well as
positive associations between high blood pressure and smoking.4 But though the Framingham study
is often cited as “proof” of the lipid hypothesis, senior investigator William Castelli, MD, apparently
had serious doubts.

In a much-quoted article in JAMA Internal Medicine  he wrote the following:
Most of what we know about the effects of diet factors, particularly the saturation of fat and choles -
terol, on serum lipid parameters derives from metabolic ward-type studies.

Alas, such findings, within
a cohort studied over time have been disappointing, indeed the findings have been contradictory.

For
example, in Framingham, Mass., the more saturated fat one ate, the more cholesterol one ate, the more
calories one ate, the lower the person’s serum cholesterol.

The opposite of what one saw in the 26
metabolic ward studies, the opposite of what the equations provided by Hegsted et al.

and Keys et al.5
At least three major review6–8 studies have shown no relationship between saturated fat in the diet
and heart disease, and certainly no advantage in swapping carbohydrate for saturated fat.

In fact,
just the opposite is the case.

Mozaffarian et al.9 actually showed that risk factors for heart disease
go up when you substitute carbohydrates for saturated fat.

Jakobsen et al.10 compared the associa -
tion between saturated fats and carbohydrates with ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk among 53,644
men and women in a Danish cohort of the Diet, Cancer, and Health Study and found that saturated
fat intake was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (MI) compared with carbohydrate
consumption, leading to an editorial in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  by Frank Hu,
entitled “Are refined carbohydrates worse than saturated fat?”11
The hypothesis that cholesterol and saturated fat are major promoters of heart disease has had more
than its fair share of black swan-type studies, and yet, the establishment continues to dismiss these
studies as either anomalies or outliers.

In some cases, they simply ignore them.

The cholesterol estab -
lishment at this point is so entrenched and has so many tentacles into industry, government, and medi -
cine (Big Food and it is “low-fat” products, the incredibly sophisticated and extremely well-funded
marketing machine of the pharmaceutical industry, the National Cholesterol Education Program, the
American Heart Association), that “rapid response” teams are able to effectively marginalize any
studies whose results call into question the basic tenants of cholesterol dogma.

(How do we explain
away a study showing no benefit to lowering cholesterol?

Simple: they did not lower it enough !

).

An example of this kind of thinking about fat and cholesterol can be seen in something known
as “the French Paradox.” For years, we were taught that the French had lower rates of heart disease
despite  the fact that they consumed copious amounts of saturated fat, a puzzlement no one could
apparently figure out.

So we were taught to think of this as a paradox  (the secular version of a miracle )
because we could not bring ourselves to rethink the paradigm  that saturated fat causes heart dis -
ease.

Given the massive cognitive dissonance engendered by these conflicting “truths”— saturated
fat causes heart disease, the French eat a ton of saturated fat, the French have low rates of heart
disease —we “reconciled” them in the only way possible: we called it a “paradox.” Of course, if one of
those accepted “truths” is wrong—i.e., if saturated fat does not cause heart disease in the first place—
there is no paradox at all.

The French eat a lot of fat, they do not have much heart disease, so what?

(It is only a paradox if both premises are true.)

But to consider this possibility would require what
Thomas Kuhn, in his classic book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , called a “paradigm shift.”12
We think a paradigm shift is exactly what is needed when it comes to thinking about cholesterol.

The case against cholesterol was made in the middle of the twentieth century, became the
“accepted wisdom” in the mid-1980s, and in the ensuing years has become a petrified, sclerotic
dogma.

The current paradigm—that cholesterol is measured in an accurate and meaningful way,
that it is the major initiator of heart disease, and that reducing it will lower the incidence of heart 4 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
disease—is simply no longer supportable by the available evidence.

Cardiologist Laura Corr of
Guys and St. Thomas’ Hospitals, writing in the European Heart Journal ,13 put it best:
The commonly-held belief that the best diet for prevention of coronary heart disease is a low saturated
fat, low cholesterol diet is not supported by the available evidence from clinical trials.

In primary pre -
vention, such diets do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or coronary or all-cause-mortality.

In primary pre -
vention, such diets do not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or coronary or all-cause-mortality.

Cost-benefit analyses of the extensive primary prevention programs, which are at present vigorously
supported by Governments, Health Departments and health educationalists, are urgently required.

The case against cholesterol and saturated fat deserves to be reopened.

A LITTLE HISTORY
The cholesterol hypothesis—the general name for two distinct but related theories called the “diet-
heart hypothesis” and the “lipid hypothesis”—had its nascent beginnings around the turn of the
century.

And it all started with rabbits.

In 1913, a Russian experimenter named Nikolai Anichkov discovered that when you fed rabbits
large amounts of cholesterol, they developed atherosclerosis.

As Konstantinov et al.

point out in an
article in the Texas Heart Institute Journal ,14 Anichkov’s classic experiments literally paved the
way to our current beliefs about the role of cholesterol in CVD.

Anichkov’s work was considered so
important that in 1958—in an editorial in Annals of Internal Medicine  no less—it was compared to
the discovery of the tubercle bacillus by Robert Koch.15
But rabbits are, after all, vegetarians, and their bodies have no idea what to do with an animal
product like cholesterol.

(Dogs and baboons, for example, do not respond the same way to choles -
terol feeding as rabbits do.)

Putting aside the question of whether cholesterol-fed rabbits are the
best choice for demonstrating metabolic mechanisms in humans, Anichkov’s work actually raises a
couple of other interesting points about cholesterol and heart disease.

One: the cholesterol-fed rabbits did develop atherosclerosis—but they did not get heart attacks.

This is important.

One of the main determinants of plaque rupture is the balance between collagen
synthesis and collagen degradation, a process that requires vitamin C.16 The most abundant amino
acids in collagen are proline and lysine, and when collagen is damaged, these two amino acids
become exposed.

Lipoprotein(a)—a highly atherogenic cholesterol particle—is attracted to both
lysine and proline, and will attach itself to the now exposed and damaged strands of collagen.

“It
is an attempt by the body to repair damage to the collagen of the artery walls in the absence of
adequate levels of vitamin C,” writes Andrew W. Saul, PhD.17
Unfortunately the repair is not ideal and over many years repeated deposits can cause the artery to
become narrow and inflamed.

Heart attack or stroke is likely to follow (usually caused by a clot form -
ing at the site of the narrowed artery, or by a piece of plaque breaking off and blocking a smaller ves -
sel downstream).

When vitamin C levels are low, the body manufactures more cholesterol, especially
Lp(a).

Conversely, when vitamin C levels are high the body makes less cholesterol.

“If high blood cholesterol were the primary cause of heart disease, all bears and other hibernating
animals would have become extinct long ago,” writes Dr. Saul.

“They naturally have high cholesterol
levels.

One reason bears are still with us is simple: they produce large amounts of vitamin C in their
bodies, which stabilizes the artery walls, and there is therefore no tendency to develop cholesterol
deposits or plaque.” Guinea pigs, like humans, cannot make their own vitamin C, and if you deprive
a guinea pig of vitamin C it develops damage to the arteries within a few short weeks.

A 1992 review
of the literature on vitamin C and CVD in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition  found
that “Evidence linking vitamin C to human CVD is largely circumstantial, but taken in total, is sug -
gestive of an association” and called for further examination of the relationship.18 Further examina -
tion is exactly what was done in 2011, when a study in the American Heart Journal  found that plasma
vitamin C did indeed predict incident heart failure in both men and women.195 Myths of Cholesterol
The second thing Anichkov demonstrated was that when cholesterol was injected  into the rabbits,
rather than fed to them, no atherosclerosis was found.

This should immediately raise some eye -
brows.

Ingest arsenic orally or inject it into the bloodstream, either way you wind up dead.

But the
fate of injected  cholesterol and ingested  cholesterol in the body are quite different.

When eaten, cho -
lesterol is packaged by the liver into carriers known as lipoproteins.

(That does not happen when you
inject  cholesterol.)

So when we are “measuring cholesterol” we are actually measuring lipoproteins ,
an important distinction.

Let us not forget that cholesterol is a passenger  on the lipoprotein boat, but
the boat itself —the lipoprotein—also has activities and characteristics that need to be examined.

Nonetheless, the idea that cholesterol and atherosclerosis were somehow related in a causal way
remained in the scientific ether, to be resurrected with a vengeance in the mid-twentieth century.

Here is how it happened.

It was the middle of the twentieth century.

Young men were returning from the front lines of the
war and were inexplicably showing signs of heart disease.

Remember that heart disease, as we know
it today, was far less common in the beginning of the twentieth century—in fact, the very term for
a specialist in heart disease—“cardiologist”—was hardly used at all till the second decade of the
century.20 So, for apparently healthy young men to suddenly be showing signs of CVD at unprec -
edented rates was a remarkable and alarming phenomenon.

There was a demand for explanations, and an even stronger demand for action.

What was caus -
ing this “epidemic” of heart disease, and, more importantly, what could be done about it?

The
McGovern Select Committee on Nutrition had been formed in 1968 under President Nixon, largely
to deal with food insecurity and hunger, and by 1974—3 years before it was disbanded—the com -
mittee decided to expand its focus to include the nation’s nutrition policy.

Hard to imagine now, but
the nascent belief that diet could be a factor in disease, including heart disease, was very far from
universally accepted.

For the government to make dietary recommendations as a public health mea -
sure was pretty radical.

Still, there was a feeling among the committee members that before going
off into the sunset, they ought to do it.

Enter a physiologist named Ancel Keys.

Keys was a respected researcher who invented the K-rations used by the U.S. Army, and did
research on the physiology of starvation in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment.21 He was well
aware of the previous work on cholesterol-fed rabbits, and was convinced that diet played a major
role in heart disease.

Specifically, he believed that saturated fat in the diet raised cholesterol in the
blood, which in turn put one at great risk for heart disease (this was called “the diet-heart hypoth -
esis”).

(Interestingly, he never believed that cholesterol in the diet mattered a whit.)

When stationed in Pioppi, Italy, in the 1940s, Keys chatted with doctors from the Mediterranean
regions who pointed out that heart disease was rare in the area, and Keys came to believe that the
main reason this was so was because they ate less saturated fat.

He postulated a connection between
cholesterol in the blood, saturated fat in the diet, and higher rates of heart disease, and designed
his classic study—the Seven Countries Study22—to demonstrate just that.

We will return to Keys
in just a moment.

This is an excellent place to discuss the actual Mediterranean diet that Keys became so enamored
of.

What we call “the Mediterranean Diet” seems to be the only dietary pattern nearly everyone in
the field of nutrition agrees is “good,” even though it is extremely hard to get a solid, specific defini -
tion of what the Mediterranean diet is, and even harder to get agreement on what elements in the
diet—or the Mediterranean lifestyle in general—is responsible for the benefits.

Understanding how
we think about the Mediterranean diet will actually help us understand some of the flaws in our
thinking about cholesterol and saturated fat.

What we know as “The Mediterranean Diet” is actually inspired by traditional patterns of eat -
ing in Greece, Spain, and Southern Italy.

Though there are many more versions of Mediterranean
eating than you might imagine, the pattern is generally characterized by large amounts of olive oil,
unrefined cereals, vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish, poultry, moderate wine, and moderate dairy with
relatively small amounts of red meat.6 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
A meatless, low-fat diet is hardly typical of all Mediterranean cuisine.

Lamb is widely eaten—
though it is almost always grass-fed, an enormous distinction that too often goes unnoticed.

Lard
and butter are commonly used in Northern Italy, and, with some exceptions, sheep’s tail fat and
rendered butter (samma) are traditional staple fats in North Africa and the Middle East.23 Though
much of the world believes—wrongly, we feel—that the benefits of the Mediterranean diet accrue
because it is low in meat and saturated fat, an equally good case can be made that the benefits accrue
because it is low in sugar.

That there is a robust association between what we know as the Mediterranean pattern of eating
and better health is not in question.

However, as mentioned above, the reason  for that association
is not nearly as clear.

Keys began his research convinced that the culprit in the American diet was
saturated fat, and he was able to find data that seemed (if you did not look too carefully) to confirm
that.

(Neuroeconomists would call this “confirmation bias”—the tendency to read the evidence in a
way that confirms what you already believe).

But there is a lot more to the Mediterranean diet than
a comparatively low intake of saturated fat.

The Mediterranean diet pattern is startlingly low in sugar and in highly processed carbs.

Those
in the Mediterranean region rarely snack, and hardly ever on the processed snack foods that are
endemic in the United States.

But the diet is characterized not just by what they eat less of, but what
they eat more  of: nuts, vegetables, fiber, and high-antioxidant oils.

According to Walter Willett, MD,
whose research at Harvard was in part responsible for the acceptance of the Mediterranean eating
plan by virtually everyone as the poster-diet for healthy eating, traditional Mediterranean diets used
plenty of fruits and vegetables, are higher in fat, and are relatively low in easily digested carbohy -
drates.

Because of this, they also have a relatively low impact on blood sugar.24
To attribute their lower rates of heart disease to a lower level of saturated fat in the diet is a
faith-based attribution.

It is not justified by science, and it is in no way supported by actual evi -
dence.

It is not justified by science, and it is in no way supported by actual evi -
dence.

What we have in the Mediterranean region is a multifactorial lifestyle that involves a host of
variables including activity, community, sunlight, snacking behavior, sugar consumption, sleep pat -
terns, and more options for dealing with stress and isolation, a vastly different picture from the one
we see in the United States.

Yet, we continue to cling to the dogma that there is less heart disease in
the Mediterranean because they eat less red meat and saturated fat.

The idea of a multifactorial design producing a result, which is then attributed to one factor in
the design, is something that has been seen before in what has become an increasingly partisan war
over the role of fat and cholesterol in heart disease.

One of the most glaring examples of this is the
famous “reversing heart disease” study by one of the biggest proponents of the low-fat diet, Dean
Ornish, MD.

Ornish’s reputation—and much of the public’s faith in the low-fat diet approach—was fueled by
his famous 5-year intervention study (the Lifestyle Heart Trial), which demonstrated that intensive
lifestyle changes may lead to regression of CHD.25 Ornish took 48 middle-aged white men with
moderate to severe CHD and assigned them to two groups.

One group received “usual care,” and
the other group received a special, intensive five-part lifestyle intervention consisting of (1) aerobic
exercise, (2) stress management training, (3) smoking cessation, (4) group psychological support,
and (5) a strict vegetarian diet that itself had several subcharacteristics including a high amount of
fiber, almost no sugar, a large amount of natural anti-inflammatories and antioxidants from veg -
etables and fruits, and, incidentally, only 10% of calories coming from fat.

Ornish had a drop-out rate of almost 50%, but of the 20 men who completed the 5-year study,
there were fewer cardiac events and a significant reversal of atherosclerosis.

But the public percep -
tion of this study—strongly reinforced by Ornish himself—was that his results were due to the low-
fat component of the program.

This may be true—but there is absolutely no way to know it from the
study design.

(Imagine that you gave patients a daily dose of a three-drug cocktail, changed their
diet, fixed their sleep apnea, taught them to exercise, got them meditating, and then found out—after
5 years—that their incidence of asthma was greatly reduced compared to a control group.

Could
you reasonably claim with a straight face that your asthma-eradicating results were due to one of the 7 Myths of Cholesterol
drugs?

Or, for that matter, due to the mediation?

No beginning statistics student would ever make a
mistake like that, yet that is exactly what Ornish did.)

There is absolutely no way to know whether the results of Ornish’s reversing heart disease study
were due to the high fiber, the whole foods, the lack of sugar, or some combination of the interven -
tions.

It is entirely possible that Ornish would have gotten the same or better results with a program
of exercise, stress management, smoking cessation, group therapy, and whole foods—low-glycemic
diet that included plenty  of saturated fat and protein.

Attributing his results to the low-fat diet is
as silly as attributing the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet to a slightly lower amount of
saturated fat.

Back to Keys, a perfect segue from the discussion of confirmation bias.

There is much misinfor -
mation about Keys in the “cholesterol skeptic” community.

It is widely believed that he deleted data
from his famous Seven Countries study to make a stronger case for the fat–heart disease connection
(not true), that he cherry picked evidence (true), and that when all the evidence he chose to ignore
was put back into the equation, the association between fat and heart disease disappeared (partly
true).

Here is what actually happened.

Here is what actually happened.

*
As we have seen, Keys proposed that saturated fat in the diet and cholesterol in the blood were
the major variables responsible for the high rates of heart disease seen in industrialized countries
such as the United States.

He decided to demonstrate this by analyzing data on saturated fat con -
sumption and heart disease in six different countries, producing an article that was known as the
Six Countries Study.

He presented that article—and his theory about fat and cholesterol—at a
1955 world Health Organization conference (its first Expert Committee on the Pathogenesis of
Atherosclerosis), which met to discuss what was perceived as an “epidemic” of heart disease.

It did not go well.

“Ancel Keys, known for his sharp, blunt, and biting commentary, was reportedly true to form
at the conference,” writes Anthony Colpo.26 “But when the outspoken Minnesotan confidently put
forth his dietary theory of heart disease at this hallmark gathering, he was greeted with consider -
able skepticism.

Henry Blackburn, a long time collaborator of Keys, recalls that the researcher was
‘flabbergasted to find that his ideas were not accepted on the spot’.”26
Apparently, when Keys prepared his “case” using the six countries where saturated fat and heart
disease had a positive correlation, there was data available on 22 countries.

Keys “selected” the
countries he felt would make the strongest case for the association.

When you factor in the other
22 countries, the association between saturated fat and heart disease all but disappears.

(It is still
there—but it is significantly weaker [and confounded by other seemingly contradictory associa -
tions like the inverse  association between animal fat consumption and mortality27]).

“Instead of
a perfectly uniform pattern, the resultant graph looked more like the holes on an old dartboard—
all over the place!,” writes Colpo.26 George Mann—a well-known researcher from the University
of Vanderbilt who was an outspoken critic of the cholesterol hypothesis discovered that in many
countries physical activity was the most accurate predictor of heart disease risk, and that Keys had
conveniently deleted those countries from his presentation.26
Meanwhile, across the pond, another researcher was questioning Keys’ views and offering a
different hypothesis.

John Yudkin, MD, from the University of London, believed that Keys was
so focused on proving the connection between fat and heart disease that he was missing many
other compelling connections between diet and heart disease.

In an article published in The Lancet
entitled “Diet and Coronary Thrombosis: Hypothesis and Fact”28 he stated, “… one begins to have
the uneasy feeling that both the proponents and opponents of a dietary hypothesis are quoting only
those data which support their view.”

Yudkin’s research showed there were countries that had similar intakes of fat but as much as a
fourfold difference in coronary mortality.

He also questioned the demonization of animal fat:
It has been suggested that the amount of animal fats, from milk and from meat, is more important
than the amount of total fat in causing coronary thrombosis.

The figures do not support this, since the
relationship is less direct than with total fats.

Those who believe that the culprit is butter fat, from but -
ter, milk, and cheese, receive even less support.

Those who believe that the culprit is butter fat, from but -
ter, milk, and cheese, receive even less support.

Nor is there support for the view that vegetable fat is
protective, for there is no relationship, either positive or negative between the intake of vegetable fat
and coronary mortality.28
Yudkin’s most important finding was there was indeed a dietary component that tracked well
with heart disease, much better, in fact, than fat did.

That dietary component was sugar.

“There is a
better relationship with intake of sugar than with any other nutrient we have examined,” he writes.28
“These international comparisons, then, do not support the view that total fat or animal fat is the
direct and single cause of coronary thrombosis.

Neither do they support the view that (saturated) fats
are related at all to coronary thrombosis.

The relationships which do emerge, especially that with
sugar, suggest that coronary thrombosis is associated with higher living standards.

This is supported
by the relationship which exists between coronary mortality and national income per head.”28
In fact, the very best correlations Yudkin’s research uncovered was the highly significant correlation
between coronary mortality and number of radio and television licenses, followed by the correlation
between coronary mortality and the number of registered motor vehicles.28 This is important to point
out because it shows both the possibilities and the limits of correlational (association) studies.

Although
epidemiology can suggest  hypotheses—saturated fat causes heart disease, television set ownership
causes heart disease—it does not test these hypotheses, and that is the great limitation of epidemiology,
and the great danger in making health policy based on epidemiological findings.

On the other hand, the
fact that so many things about modern life track with heart disease should open us to the possibility that
stress is of far greater importance as a variable in disease than cholesterol ever was, a position suggested
by the work of neurobiologist and McArthur Genius Grant recipient Professor Robert Sapolsky.29,30
Back once again, to Keys.

Having been scorned and ridiculed at the World Health Organization
meeting where he presented the Six Countries article, he decided, in Blackburn’s words, to “show
these guys.”26 In 1958, he designed the Seven Countries Study31 that has formed the cornerstone of
our dietary policy for the past four decades and which has informed our myopic focus on cholesterol
since 1984.

He handpicked seven countries the data from which he had good reason to think would
support his theory.

He concentrated on the variables he thought were important and ignored the rest.

And—surprise, surprise—he got the expected results.

Denise Minger—whose research on this is both impeccable and wonderfully entertaining to
read—puts it beautifully:
I’m not going to pat Keys on the back for deliberately choosing countries to make his case look stronger,
but in terms of historical accuracy, we can’t say that he actually lied.

His biggest error, in fact, had less
to do with data-deletion and more to do with tunnel vision.

Along with failing to explore reasons why
fat might be linked to heart disease in a non-causal way, it seems Keys had his eyes locked so tightly on
his lovely lipids that he didn’t notice the role of other dietary factors.32
Preselecting the countries that “proved” this theory was only one of the many problems with the
Seven Countries Study.

There was also data in the study that did not add up.

For example, there was
significant variability in heart mortality within  these seven countries, even though saturated fat con -
sumption was identical.

In Finland, for example, the intake of saturated fat was almost identical in
two population groups (from Turku and North Karelia), but heart mortality was three times higher

In Finland, for example, the intake of saturated fat was almost identical in
two population groups (from Turku and North Karelia), but heart mortality was three times higher
in North Karelia.

Similarly, saturated fat intake was nearly identical on two Greek islands—Crete
and Corfu.

But heart mortality was a whopping 17 times higher on Corfu than it was on Crete!33
How did Keys explain these facts, which were clearly present in his data?

Simple.

He ignored them.9 Myths of Cholesterol
Keys was a member of the nutrition advisory committee of the American Heart Association, so
despite the flaws in his study, he managed to get his theories officially incorporated into the 1961
American Heart Association dietary guidelines34 where they have influenced government policy on
heart disease, fat consumption, and cholesterol for decades.

These guidelines accomplished their goals, not least of all in the court of public opinion.

A
famous 1984 cover of Time  magazine (“Cholesterol: And Now the Bad News….” showed a picture
of two fried eggs and a piece of bacon arranged to look like a face making a frown.

Both saturated
fat and cholesterol had been successfully labeled as the primary bad actors in the development of
heart disease, a perception that has not changed appreciably in the ensuing decades.

But does saturated fat really  promote heart disease?

And how much does lowering cholesterol
really matter anyway?

In an excellent article published in the journal Nutrition , Robert Hoenselaar attempted to answer
the first question.35 He looked at the recommendations of leading U.S. and European advisory com -
mittees on saturated fat.

He then compared their recommendations with the science they were based
on.

He argued that evidence-based dietary advice should be built on results from all studies avail -
able, according to a given methodology.

So he examined what the science actually shows about the
association between saturated fat intake and CVD and compared that with the results as they were
presented by the advisory committees in their respective reports.

He put the findings into perspec -
tive by examining studies that were not included in the advisory committee reports.

For example,
all three committee reports quoted research on the effect of saturated fat on LDL-C as evidence
for the connection of saturated fat to CVD, but systematically ignored the effect of saturated fat on
HDL.

Hoenselaar also found that both U.S. reports failed to correctly describe the results from the
prospective studies.

The advisory committees included three types of studies as support for their recommendations:
1.

Controlled trials showing that saturated fat consumption increases (LDL) cholesterol
levels.

2.

Intervention studies showing that the decrease of saturated fat and the simultaneous
increase of polyunsaturated fat in the diet decrease CVD risk.

3.

Prospective cohort studies showing a positive association between saturated fat intake and
coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.

But when Hoenselaar investigated the actual findings of the studies used to support the recom -
mendations, a very different picture emerged than the one presented by the advisory committees.

“Replacement of carbohydrates with tropical oils markedly raises total cholesterol, which is unfa -
vorable, but the picture changes if effects on HDL and apolipoprotein B are taken into account,” he
writes.35 Although the reports of the advisory committees included the effect of LDL-C on CVD in
the evidence they cited, none of the reports considered the effect of HDL-C on CVD, even though, as
Hoenselaar points out, a meta-analysis of 61 prospective studies published in The Lancet36 showed
that LDL-C and HDL-C were independent predictors of ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality.36
In fact, in that same Lancet  study, the ratio of total to HDL-C was the strongest predictor of IHD
mortality.

None of the reports explained why they did not include the data on saturated fat and HDL.

In fact, the effect of saturated fat on cholesterol is more nuanced than was previously believed.

Not only does saturated fat raise HDL-C but it has a profound effect on LDL particle size and
distribution.

Higher intake of saturated fat—in particular, myristic and palmitic acid—is inversely
correlated with concentrations of small, dense LDL, and positively associated with increased con -
centrations of larger, cholesterol-enriched LDL.37 If one looks only at total LDL numbers, this
important (and positive) effect on LDL particle size and distribution is missed.

“As long as informa -
tion directly linking  the consumption of certain fats and oils with CAD is lacking, we can never be
sure what such fats and oils do to CAD risk,” writes Hoenselaar.3510 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
The danger of using cholesterol levels as a stand-in for heart disease has been demonstrated
many times.

There is no shortage of studies showing an association between saturated fat in the
diet and cholesterol in the blood, but studies that investigated the direct result of saturated fat on
hard end-points have been less frequently done.

But at least three systemic reviews of prospective
studies have been published examining the direct  relationship between saturated fat and CVD.6–8
They show a consistent lack of an association.

One of these meta-analyses, done by Siri-Tarino
et al., included the largest number of cohorts for the association between saturated fat and CHD and
concluded that “there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associ -
ated with an increased risk of CHD or CVD.”8 Furthermore, the authors suggest that given the dif -
ferential effects of dietary saturated fats and carbohydrates on concentrations of larger and smaller
LDL particles, respectively, dietary efforts to improve the increasing burden of CVD risk associated
with atherogenic dyslipidemia should primarily emphasize the limitation of refined carbohydrates.8
In fact, one study found that in postmenopausal women with relatively low total fat intake, a
greater  saturated fat intake was associated with less progression of coronary atherosclerosis,
whereas carbohydrate intake was associated with a greater  progression,9 leading the American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition  to publish an editorial entitled, “Saturated fat prevents coronary artery
disease?

An American paradox.”38
The second question—does LDL-C matter as much as previously believed—is another matter.

In a recent article in the Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice , Petursson et al.

asked the ques -
tion, “Is the use of cholesterol in mortality risk algorithms in clinical guidelines valid?”39 Using
10 years of prospective data from the Norwegian HUNT 2 study,40 they assessed the association
of total serum cholesterol with total mortality, as well as mortality from CVD and IHD, using Cox
proportional hazard models.

They found that among women, cholesterol had an inverse  associa -
tion with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.94) as well as CVD mortality (hazard ratio 0.97).

IHD
mortality was not linear, but followed a U-shaped curve, as did the association of cholesterol with
mortality from CVD and with all-cause mortality in men.

The authors conclude, “If our findings
are generalizable, clinical and public health recommendations regarding the ‘dangers’ of cholesterol
should be revised.

This is especially true for women, for whom moderately elevated cholesterol (by
current standards) may prove to be not only harmless but even beneficial”39
Though research starting with the Framingham study has shown a strong positive association
between high-plasma HDL and reduced risk of MI, it is not entirely clear if this association is
causal.

Voight et al.41 used a Mendelian randomization model to test the hypothesis that the asso -
ciation of a plasma biomarker with disease is causal.

They found that people who inherit genes
(the LIPG  396Ser allele) that naturally give them higher HDL levels have no less heart disease
than those who inherit genes that produce slightly lower levels.

Though in observational epide -
miological studies, a 1 SD increase in HDL cholesterol is associated with reduced risk of MI, the
same 1 SD increase due to genetic score was not.

The increase in HDL cholesterol associated
with the LIPG 396Ser allele would have been expected to produce a 13% decreased risk of MI
but in fact was not associated with any reduction in risk.

Their data “challenge the concept that
raising of plasma HDL cholesterol will uniformly translate into reductions in risk of myocardial
infarction.”41
Research article published in The FASEB Journal  also suggests a rethinking of the HDL hypoth -
esis.

Scanu and Edelstein42 found that the HDL from patients with chronic diseases (kidney disease,
diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis) is different from the HDL in healthy individuals, even when
blood levels are comparable.

In an interview with Science Daily ,43 Angelo Scanu, MD, a pioneer
in blood lipid chemistry from the University of Chicago and the first author of the study, said: “For
many years, HDL has been viewed as good cholesterol and has generated a false perception that the
more HDL in the blood, the better.

It is now apparent that subjects with high HDL are not neces -
sarily protected from heart problems and should ask their doctor to find out whether their HDL is
good or bad.”11 Myths of Cholesterol
Other research also calls into question the idea that raising HDL-C always translates to a clini -
cal benefit.

In the AIM-HIGH trial,44 patients with established CVD, who had achieved target LDL
levels with statin therapy, were randomized to one of two treatments:
1.

Simvastatin (40–80 mg/day) ± ezetimibe (10 mg/day) as necessary to maintain LDL-C
below 70 mg/dL + placebo (a tiny dose of crystalline niacin to cause flushing)
2.

As in point 1, with 1500–2000 mg/day of extended release niacin instead of placebo
After 2 years, the niacin group experienced a significant increase in plasma HDL-C but no
improvement in patient survival.

(The safety board halted the trial.)

The dal-OUTCOMES study45
randomized patients to either standard of care plus placebo or standard of care plus dalcetrapib, a
CETP (cholesterylester transfer protein) inhibitor.

(Inhibition of the CETP pathway, which facili -
tates transfer of triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol ester between lipoproteins, can increase concen -
trations of HDL-C.) Over the course of the trial, HDL-C levels increased from baseline by 4%–11%
in the placebo group and by 31%–40% in the dalcetrapib group.

At a prespecified interim analysis,
the independent data and safety monitoring board recommended termination of the trial for futility.

As compared with placebo, dalcetrapib did not alter the risk of the primary end point and did not
have a significant effect on any component of the primary end point or on total mortality.

All of this begs another question, which may be even more relevant: are we measuring choles -
terol in the most useful and accurate way?

Early on in this chapter, we expressed our opinion that the standard cholesterol test—given as
part of a standard CBC—is out of date.

Here’s why.

We have known for some time that there are
different subtypes of HDL (e.g., HDL-2 and HDL-3) as well as different subtypes of LDL (LDL-a
and LDL-b).

These behave quite differently in the body, yet these differences are obscured when we measure
only HDL and LDL.

Although most HDL is indeed protective, all subtypes may not be equally so.

These behave quite differently in the body, yet these differences are obscured when we measure
only HDL and LDL.

Although most HDL is indeed protective, all subtypes may not be equally so.

HDL-2, for exam -
ple, seems to be more protective, whereas the role of HDL-3 remains equivocal.46 The differences
in subtypes of LDL are even more dramatic.

LDL-a is a large molecule, which is less atherogenic than LDL-b, which is a small, dense, oxi -
dized particle that can easily penetrate the endothelium.

Particle tests that determine what kind of
LDL one has (pattern “A” or the far less desirable pattern “B”) are more sophisticated than standard
cholesterol tests that simply divide cholesterol into “good” and “bad.” But even more predictive than
particle size is the actual number of particles.

Cromwell et al.47 followed a Framingham offspring cohort of 3066 middle-aged white partici -
pants without CVD to compare the ability of alternative measures of LDL to provide CVD risk
discrimination at relatively low levels consistent with current therapeutic targets.

Specifically, they
looked at particle number (LDL-P), and placed subjects into one of four possible groups:
1.

High LDL-C, high LDL-P
2.

High LDL-C, low LDL-P
3.

Low LDL-C, high LDL-P
4.

Low LDL-C, low LDL-P
They found that LDL-C is only a good predictor of adverse cardiac events when it is concordant
with LDL-P (meaning both variables move in the same direction).

When the two variables are
discordant, LDL-C was found to be a poor predictor of risk.

Those with the worst survival had
low (below median) LDL-C but high LDL-P.

They were also most likely to have either small LDL
particles or TG-rich/cholesterol poor LDL particles, or both (e.g., those with insulin resistance,
metabolic syndrome, or type II diabetes).12 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
“Discordance between LDL-C and LDL-P is even greater in populations with metabolic syn -
drome, including patients with diabetes,” writes Peter Attia, MD.48 “Given the ubiquity of these
conditions in the U.S. population, and the special risk such patients carry for cardiovascular disease,
it is difficult to justify use of LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG alone for risk stratification in all but the most
select patients.” Attia points out that in patients without metabolic syndrome, LDL-C under-predicts
cardiac risk 22% of the time.

But in patients with metabolic syndrome, LDL-C under-predicts 63%
of the time.48
In an article published in the American Journal of Cardiology  in 2012, Malave et al.49 assessed
variations in lipoprotein particle concentrations in patients with diabetes with “very low” LDL-C
and non-HDL-C levels to elucidate the drivers of cardiovascular risk.

They concluded that patients
with diabetes exhibited significant variation in LDL particle level, despite attainment of target
LDL-C, “suggesting the persistence of potential residual coronary heart disease risk.”
We began this chapter by discussing how what we see is affected by what we believe (confir -
mation bias).

We can think of no better example than a study published in the American Heart
Journal ,50 which tracked 231,986 hospitalizations from 541 hospitals.

In this study, it was found
that almost half the patients hospitalized with CAD had admission LDL levels <100 mg/dL, with
less than 10% having HDL levels ≥60 mg/dL.

Rather than concluding that LDL-C has outworn
its usefulness as a predictor, the researchers suggest that their study provides “further support for
recent guideline revisions with even lower LDL goals and for developing effective treatments to
raise HDL.”
The single-minded focus on cholesterol—particularly on LDL-C—has outlived its usefulness.

Cholesterol is cargo on lipoprotein boats—we need to turn our attention to the boats themselves.

Cholesterol is cargo on lipoprotein boats—we need to turn our attention to the boats themselves.

The deterioration of lipoproteins, the oxidation of their membranes, the time they spend in the
bloodstream, and the functionality of the LDL receptors all deserve careful attention.

Heart dis -
ease is multifactorial and our preventive efforts should at least include a recognition that there are
more sophisticated and useful measures than LDL-C, and that inflammation, oxidative damage, and
stress play major—and largely unappreciated—roles in its development.

The demonization of satu -
rated fat has turned out to be not just wrong, but counterproductive.

It has fostered the widespread
belief that the wholesale replacement of saturated fat by (proinflammatory, omega-6-rich) vegetable
oils is desirable.

This has resulted in an unhealthy ratio of 16:1 omega-6 to omega-3 in the diet, and
has contributed mightily to the inflammation, which underlines the atherosclerotic progression.51
“Empiricists are those of us who believe what we see, and rationalists are those who see what we
believe,” wrote the legendary teacher Sidney Baker, MD.52 “It seems to me that the belief system of
modern medicine has become something of a handicap in permitting us to see well.”

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Beverly B. Teter
The heart is one organ in the body that never gets to rest.

It must work efficiently every day and all
day—or within a few moments we are dead.

However, it has to depend on other organs of the body to
supply its needs for energy, oxygen, waste disposal, and sometimes exercise.

In a sense every organ
supports the heart and the heart supports every other organ by delivering the blood supply.

The brain
has to figure out how to find food, of course, and the eyes and ears also play a roll.

The skeleton is
essential for protection and support for internal organs and to support movement in the search for
food.

The intestinal tract has to process the food into a suitable form for efficient use along with the
help of the liver.

The liver is involved in processing toxins for disposal, making urea from ammonia,
making and packaging lipids for transport throughout the body as lipoproteins (LDL, HDL, chylo -
microns, etc.)

and producing bile acids to aide digestion.

directly.1 The lungs have to supply oxygen essential for producing the energy necessary to fuel the
heart and all other organs and also for disposing carbon dioxide produced in the process.

The kidneys
need to clear toxic waste material and maintain appropriate electrolyte and urea levels as well as
reabsorb water as needed.

It is important to understand the energy needs of the heart to maintain its
continuous function from the beginning of life to the end.

The beta oxidation of fats in mitochondrial
myocytes provides 60%–70% of energy in the heart.

The beta oxidation of fats in mitochondrial
myocytes provides 60%–70% of energy in the heart.

Thus, it is essential to have a clear understanding
of the nature and basics of FAs as a nutritional strategy in cardiovascular disease.

TYPES OF DIETARY FATS
Fatty acid-containing  Fats
FAs are usually part of triglycerides (TGs) or phospholipids (PLs) and can be liberated from TGs,
diglycerides (DGs), or monoglycerides (MGs) as well as PLs by lipase enzymes.

FAs may be sat -
urated (SFAs), monounsaturated (MFAs), or polyunsaturated (PUFAs).

The degree of saturation
depends on the number of double bonds in the FA carbon chain.

The naturally occurring double
bonds are in the cis confirmation due to the enzymes involved in desaturation.

They may have trans
double bonds from partial hydrogenation by either chemical (industrial) or bacterial (rumen) modi -
fication, in which case they may possess unique metabolic activity.

TGs are three FAs per molecule esterified to a glycerol backbone.

These are found in animal
depot fat and mammalian milks, lipoproteins in animal bodies (HDL, LDL, etc.

), sea animals, as
well as plant oils.

They can be made by most animals and humans from either ingesting fatty acid-
containing foods or synthesized from acetate.

One of the functions of TG is that of an energy store.

When needed, the depot fat can mobilize and provide FAs for energy.

PLs contain two FAs per molecule at the 1 and 2 positions and are found mostly in cell mem -
branes of animals and plants.

The third position on the glycerol of a PL molecule is occupied by
phosphate.

Often, the phosphate is bonded to another compound such as choline.

PLs are the major
lipids in cell membranes and intercellular membranes.

Lung surfactant is di-palmitoyl phosphatidyl
choline and is essential for proper lung function.

PLs in the membranes of animal foods such as
salmon, beef, or liver can provide an appreciable amount of our fatty acid intake and are rich in
essential fatty acids (EFAs).

EFAs need to be consumed in the diet as our body cannot make them.

They can be modified once consumed, but the initial structure must be consumed as either omega-6
or omega-3 FAs usually attached to PLs.

Cholesterol esters (CEs) are a combination of one cholesterol molecule with one fatty acid.

Cholesterol and other sterols from plants are usually present as an FA ester, often with PUFA as
the FA.

Cholesterol and its esters play a major role in maintaining the proper membrane fluidity
for both cell membranes and the intercellular organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticu -
lum (ER), and so on.

Cholesterol is a precursor for CEs, bile salts, testosterone, β-estradiol, and
1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3.

To utilize the energy from the above lipid classes, the FAs need to be separated from the lipid
molecule by various lipases.

They are then converted to ketone bodies, mostly by the liver, and
either used in situ or transported to tissues via the circulatory system.

TYPES OF FATTY ACIDS
FAs can be classified in several ways—by degree of saturation, by chain length, by position of the
double bonds, and by metabolic functions.

The SFAs have no double bonds.

Their chain length is
usually 4- to 18-carbon long but some of the waxes are much longer.

The MFAs have one double
bond, often at the Δ9 position of the carbon chain.

The PUFAs have multiple double bonds mostly
depending on their chain length.

The most prevalent PUFA pattern of unsaturation is -C =C-C-
C=C-, which is called methylene-interrupted double bonds.17 Fats and Cardiovascular Disease
Another class of FAs is the conjugated fatty acids (CLA).

They have double bonds with a dif -
ferent pattern of unsaturation.

Most are 18 or perhaps more carbons with two double bonds in the
-C-C =C-C=C- configuration.

Because of the preponderance of 18 carbon chain lengths, these FAs
are called conjugated linoleic acid.

Most are 18 or perhaps more carbons with two double bonds in the
-C-C =C-C=C- configuration.

Because of the preponderance of 18 carbon chain lengths, these FAs
are called conjugated linoleic acid.

They have unique properties depending on the carbon positions
of the double bonds.

The 9c, 11t—CLA has a cis bond at the 9th position and a trans  bond at the
11th position of the chain.

This isomer is very anticarcinogenic2 and found in adequate quantities
in full-fat cow’s milk.

It is enzymatically made in the rumen from the linoleic acid in the feed fed
the cows.

However, a CLA with the double bonds in the t10 and c-12 position, known as t-10, c-12-
CLA, is pro-tumorogenic3 and causes fatty liver in animals, and body weight loss just by shifting
the  position of the bonds and geometric configuration.

Polyunsaturated  Fatty acids
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
One group of PUFA is called omega-3 FAs.

They can occur in TGs, CEs or PLs as well as free
fatty acids (FFAs).

They have a double bond at the n-3-position in the fatty acid chain.

This is three
carbons from the methyl end of the long-chain FAs.

Since FAs are elongated from the carboxyl
end of the chain, once established the double bond does not move during elongation and further
desaturation.

The prostaglandins and leukotrienes formed from these FAs are generally thought
to be anti-inflammatory as opposed to the omega-6 FAs found in abundance in vegetable oils.

The
most abundant source of the omega-3 FAs is in fish oil from cold-water fish.

They act as “antifreeze”
for the fish because the long-chain omega-3s have very low melting points in the −11°C to −50°C
range depending on the number of double bonds.

Some melting points have not been determined.

This means that they are fluid even at extreme temperatures despite having 20–24 or more carbons
in their carbon chains.

This confers fluidity to the cell membranes and allows proteins (enzymes)
to assume their “favored” shapes for optimal activity.

It is especially helpful for the cold-water fish
and mammals that exist in extremely cold waters.

There is abundant evidence that the omega-3s are protective for heart diseases.

This work was first
done with northern Eskimos who have very low rates of heart disease on their normal diets.4,5 Since
this early work, there have been numerous studies that confirm the beneficial effects of omega-3s.

The blood levels in patients are easily measured by a finger-stick sample mailed to labs for analysis.

The fish or algal sources of these FAs are better to raise blood levels as the omega-3 FAs from plant
sources are generally only 18 carbons long, thus the body needs to elongate and further desaturate
them to the useful 20 to 24 + chain lengths.

Some people, especially infants and elderly, cannot do
this effectively if their liver enzymes are compromised.

This lack of ability to elongate and desatu -
rate is the reason that cats are obligatory carnivores, they need the omega-3s from their prey.

A recent research report6 indicates that EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) compared to other omega-3
FAs has a dramatic effect on cell metabolism.

They studied the effects in THP-1 cells (a human
leukemia cell line) when different oils were provided to the cultures to study various aspects of
an oil rich in EPA on gene expression and activation of nuclear receptors.

The EPA oil altered the
expression of several genes including stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) and FA desaturase-1 and FA
desaturase-2 (FASDS-1 and FASDS-2).

The other omega-3s also resulted in altered gene expres -
sion for subsets of genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammation.

The EPA activated human
peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor α (PPAR α) and also PPAR β had minimal effects on
PPAR γ, liver-X-receptor, retinoid-X-receptor, Farnesoid-X-receptor, and retinoid-acid-receptor γ
(RAR γ).

When the cultured cells were “fed” with serum from humans fed diets supplemented with
oils using olive oil as the control and DHA and two levels of EPA as test supplements, the expression
of SCD and FADS-2 in the cells treated with serum from omega-3-supplemented individuals was
decreased.

The authors conclude that the regulation of gene expression in the individuals treated
with EPA is consistent with treating aspects of dyslipidemia and inflammation.

These two condi -
tions are considered risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD).18 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Omega-6 Fatty Acids
Another grouping of PUFAs is the omega-6 group.

In this group, the first double bond from the
methyl end of the FA is in the omega-6 position.

They also have additional double bonds in other
positions of the carbon chain.

The longer the chain, the more unsaturated the molecule is.

This
type of FA is found in large amounts in most dietary vegetable oils except olive oil, which is very
rich in oleic acid.

This family of FA can lead to more inflammation than the omega-3 version.

The
downstream metabolites formed such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and so on are often involved
with inflammation.

In the mid-1970s, it was discovered that linoleic acid was able to suppress the
stimulation of the immune system by antigens and even more suppression was observed with the
prostaglandins that were produced from the omega-6 FAs.7
In 1944 and 1946, Miller studied the effects of different dietary fats on the development of
hepatomas.

Rats were fed one of the following fats, and DMB ( p-dimethylaminoazo-benzene)-
induced tumor incidence was reported.

The following fats were fed at 5% of the diet: corn oil,
hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO), coconut oil (CO), trilaurin, or corn oil–HCO [4:1].

Rats fed
corn oil or corn oil–HCO [4:1] exhibited the highest level of hepatomas.

For the second study, the
rats were fed 5% corn or olive oil, and either 20% corn oil, lard, or Crisco.

The effects on DAB-
induced hepatomas were studied.

The animals fed corn oil or corn oil–HCO exhibited the highest
levels of hepatomas.8 The second study provided 5% corn or olive oil and 20% corn oil, lard, or
Crisco to DAB-induced rats.

Hepatomas observed at the 5% level of fat after 4 months were 73%
for corn and 13% for olive oil.

At the 20% level, the incidence of hepatomas was corn oil 100%,
lard 60%, and Crisco 47%.

The animals on a fat-free diet had 8% hepatomas, but displayed EFA
deficiency.9
High omega-6 dietary oils have been used to suppress the immune system after kidney trans -
plants.

Unfortunately, these FAs are also associated with promoting tumor growth, possibly by
damping down the body’s immune system.

This may happen due to oxidation and formation of
peroxides.

Another effect could be that they provide the PUFAs necessary for rapid growth of
tumor cells that have to make cell walls and intracellular organelles such as mitochondria to provide
energy for rapid growth.

Cancer cells cannot live on fat or ketones.

They have an absolute require -
ment for glucose to produce energy.

The omega-6 FAs are EFAs but are needed only in small amounts.

The U.S. diet is overloaded
with omega-6 FAs and undernourished with omega-3 FAs.

Monounsaturated  Fatty acids
The monounsaturated fatty acids (MFAs) have intermediate properties between the PUFAs and
SFAs.

For the same chain length, i.e., 18 carbons, they have an intermediate melting point—stearate
(18:0), the saturated 18-carbon fatty acid melts at 69.6oC; oleate (18:1 Δ9cis) melts at 10.5oC, linoleic
(all cis 9,12 −18:2) melts at −8.0oC; while α-linolenic (18:3 all, cis 9,12,15) melts at −11oC.

The melt -
ing points for the comparable FAs with the double bonds in the trans  configuration would be −18:1t =
45oC; 18:2tt = 26.5oC.

The reason for differences in metabolic action of the trans  and cis isomers
of FAs has been elusive.

The reason for differences in metabolic action of the trans  and cis isomers
of FAs has been elusive.

Dietary trans fatty acids (tFAs) are generally a mixture of isomers, which
makes identifying the effect of any single isomer difficult.

A recent work using cultured macrophages studied the individual effects of trans -9 18:1 (elaidic
acid) and cis-9 18:1 (oleic acid) in tissue culture where the conditions are controlled.10 They observed
that the trans  isomer, elaidic acid, stabilized the macrophage ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette trans -
porter A1) protein levels compared to the cis isomer.

This transporter is the rate-limiting step initiat -
ing apolipoprotein A-1 lipidation.

The mechanism responsible for the different effects of oleic and
elaidic acids on ABCA1 levels was due to protein degradation in cells treated with oleic acid.

Thus,
these two isomers, which differed only by the configuration of the double bond, caused different
metabolic effects.19 Fats and Cardiovascular Disease
The most popular oleic-MFA is olive oil, which is considered the most representative food of the
traditional Mediterranean diet.

Observational studies from Mediterranean cohorts have suggested
that dietary MFA are protective against not only cardiovascular disease but also age-related cogni -
tive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.11 Although high-oleic safflower oil and sunflower oil have a
predominance of monounsaturated fats, the most popular culinary and medicinal oil is olive oil,
as the Mediterranean diet utilizing olive oil has been shown to improve cardiovascular risk, blood
pressure, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and lipid profiles.11
saturated  Fatty acids: a c ontroversial  subject
Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are the end product of the synthesis of fat by human and animal bodies.

FA synthesis takes place in the cytosol of the cells.

Any food consumed that is not used immediately
for energy is converted to fat to be stored until needed.

The excess food is converted to acetyl-CoA in
the mitochondria and sent to the cytosol where the FAs are made by the endoplasmic reticulum.

The
storage form is as TGs and the depot is adipose tissue.

Saturated fat is only oxidized by appropriate
enzymes used in the process of making ATP from the carbon chain of the FA or by being converted
to ketone bodies that are the major energy source for most of the essential organs in the body, i.e.,
liver, kidney (except the medulla), and heart.

The SFAs do not form ROS (reactive oxygen species)
as do the unsaturated fatty acids.

The more double bonds, the more ROSs can be formed.

The liver
makes ketones to send out to the rest of the body.

Many organs can make them if necessary.

During
times of stress or low blood sugar, all the tissues of the body can convert to a ketone metabolism.

Ketones are the most efficient substrate with which the body makes energy (see “Ketone Bodies”).

After World War II, laws were passed that margarine could be colored to look like butter.

During
the war, butter was being shipped to the troops, and margarine for stateside consumption was white
like shortening with a “color bubble” inside the plastic bag that could be broken and mixed to give it
color.

The dairy industry had lost its edge as the only table spread!

To increase sales of margarine,
it was packaged as “sticks of butter” and advertising campaigns were launched.

The hydrogenation
process had been developed to the point that margarine could be made to be soft and sold as a spread or
to be made “hard” to be used as butter, or made in-between to be used as shortening.

About the same
time, the Diet/Heart Hypothesis was developed.

This hypothesis was that saturated fat was unhealthy
and the unsaturated fats were good for your health.

About the same
time, the Diet/Heart Hypothesis was developed.

This hypothesis was that saturated fat was unhealthy
and the unsaturated fats were good for your health.

The background for this is described in a book by
Gary Taubes.12 Consequently, consumption of all fats deemed to be saturated were discouraged and
the newly available hydrogenated trans  FA products (which were not saturated) were encouraged to
be consumed.

Vegetable oils replaced lard and tallow in many foods and especially in the fast-food
market because of the low price.

No one paid attention to the fact that lard and olive oil have very
similar FA compositions!

Thus, vegetable oils became good and animal fat (butter, lard, tallow, meat
fat) became “bad.” The historical fats had not changed but their perception had certainly changed.

Dr. Van Itallie in 195713 stated “Now, it is no longer possible to ignore the fact that under certain
dietary conditions the serum cholesterol can be strikingly lowered by increasing the proportion of
fat in the diet.

Accordingly, the postulate relating quantity of fat intake to serum cholesterol level
has had to be drastically revised.”
The discussion of the roles of dietary saturated fat is still ongoing.

Yamagishi et al.14 report that
increasing the saturated fat in the diets of two cohorts in Japan yielded mixed results.

Cohort I was
45–64 years old in 1995 and followed until 2009.

Cohort II was aged 45–74 in 1998 and followed
until 2007.

The total number of subjects was 38,084 men and 43,847 women.

They found “inverse”
associations between SFAs and total stroke ( p = .002); intraparenchymal hemorrhage ( p for trend  =
.005); ischemic stroke ( p = .08); deep intraparenchymal hemorrhage ( p for trend = .04); lacunar
infarction ( p = .02).

They found a positive association between SFA intake and myocardial infarc -
tion (MI) ( p = .046) but no association between SFA intake and incidence of subarachnoid hemor -
rhage or sudden cardiac death.

Two other meta-analyses suggest that greater dietary SFA intake may 20 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
not be associated with increased risk of coronary disease.15,16 An article from the Harvard School of
Public health17 concludes the TC:HDL-C (total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein-cholesterol)
ratio is nonsignificantly changed by consumption of myristic or palmitic acid and  nonsignificantly
decreased by stearic acid but significantly decreased by lauric acid (found in CO).

In addition,
replacing SFAs with carbohydrate has no effect and replacing it with monounsaturated fat has
uncertain effects.

An additional meta-analysis which concentrated on dairy foods, long thought
to be a “bad” source of saturated fat, and the incidence of vascular disease and type 2 diabetes18
concluded that “there appears to be an enormous mismatch between the evidence from long-term
prospective studies and perceptions of harm from the consumption of dairy food items.

This was
based on the results of their meta-analysis that showed a reduction in risk in the subjects with the
highest dairy intake compared to the lowest intake of 0.87 in all-cause deaths; 0.92 for ischemic
heart disease; 0.79 for stroke; and 0.85 for incident diabetes.

Thus we are back to Van Itallie ʼs 1957
conclusion, now 57 years old.

ENERGY SUBSTRATES
Fatty acids
Normally, all body cells can convert fatty acids into energy for their own use.

However, some tissues pre -
fer ketone bodies for energy (see “Energy Preferences of Tissues”).

When one molecule of a 16-carbon
saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid) is converted to energy, 106 ATPs are created—as 2 ATPs are used to
form the palmitoyl CoA.

However, when one molecule of glucose is converted to CO2 and water, only
32 ATPs are produced.

If these calculations are corrected for the number of glucose carbons involved,
then the total for 16 carbons is 85 ATP which is less than 80% of the ATP yield of the 16-carbon FA.

This difference derives from the fact that glucose is already partially oxidized.

As an additional bonus,
123 water molecules are formed for every molecule of palmitoyl CoA oxidized.

When a PUFA such as
linoleate is converted to energy, two additional enzymes are needed and even more ATPs are lost.

Thus,
the more unsaturated a fat is, the less energy can be produced relative to the chain length.

In case of
severe exercise or in early starvation, the muscle cells can make their own energy but at an expense.

The
longer the chain length of the FA, the more ATP can be made; however, it will cost the cell more oxygen
and enzymes.

SFAs yield the highest energy for the length of the carbon chain.

The yield of high-energy
phosphate (ATP) from fatty acid oxidation is more from SFAs than from unsaturated fatty acids.

Hummingbirds are a prime example of the use of fat for energy.

The ruby-throated hummingbird
summers and breeds along the east coast from New England south and winters in the West Indies.

They
fly nonstop over water for a distance of about 2400 km at a velocity of about 40 km/hour for 60 hours
or so.

No protein is degraded during the flight so that their fat conversion to ketones must be rapid.

They have very large fat stores that fuel such long flights.

Oxidation of the fat provides water (123 water
molecules for every molecule of palmitoyl CoA that is oxidized while they fly over salty ocean water on
their flight).

The nonmigrating birds do not have such large body fat stores.

Another animal benefitting
from a large fat store is the camel; the hump(s) provides energy and water for long desert trips.

An additional benefit of saturated fatty acids as an energy source is that they are, by nature,
anhydrous.

This allows them to be stored as “pure” energy and not be associated with water as are
sugars and other carbohydrates.

Ronald Amundsen, the Antarctic explorer, preferred a fat energy
source over a carbohydrate one as they had to carry all their calories for the 1500-mile-round trip to
the South Pole.

As mentioned above it also provided them with fresh (warm) water.

tissue diFFerences  For PreFerred  substrates  For energy
Kidney, liver, and heart use ketones as their preferred fuel even with high blood glucose levels.

FAs can be utilized to make ketones on site in normal cells, but the liver generally makes ketones
for the heart and other tissues.

The liver is a large organ and has a good oxygenated blood supply.

21 Fats and Cardiovascular Disease
When consuming a ketogenic diet, the liver makes ketones from the dietary fats consumed and
sends them out to all other tissues of the body.

This process has several beneficial effects.

Liver has
large blood supply that carries oxygenated blood.

The oxygen required for making ketones is readily
available in the liver and spares other tissues with a less oxygenated blood supply.

Thus, when the
ketones arrive at the peripheral tissues, they are ready to use and can pass through the cell mem -
brane and into the mitochondria without carriers, insulin, oxygen, or any need to be modified for use
by the mitochondria to be converted to energy.

Furthermore, there are no waste products to be dis -
posed of by the cells.

All body tissues are capable of converting to a “ketone economy” within a few
days of becoming ketonic.

The brain can change in a few days but takes a little longer to completely
adapt.

Because ketones “burn” to carbon dioxide and water, the body actually produces metabolic
water when using ketones for energy.

The hump on a camel is fat to provide metabolic water when
on long trips in the dessert.

The hump on a camel is fat to provide metabolic water when
on long trips in the dessert.

Marathon runners maintaining a ketogenic diet find that they do not “hit
the wall” as severely as runners practicing carbohydrate loading (personal communication).

Historically, about 40%–45% cal of the U.S. diet came from fats.

Recently, the low-fat diets rec -
ommended less than 30% from fat.

Thus, since protein stays the same, the carbohydrate proportion
increased to over 40% cal.

It is questionable how effective these diets are since from 30% to 50% of
the carbohydrates consumed at each meal is converted to TGs for energy.19
All body organs can convert to a ketone economy.

Most are converted in about 3 days after start -
ing a high-fat, ketogenic diet.

The brain takes a few days longer to totally convert, but within 3 days
is functioning well.

The marathon runners maintaining a ketogenic diet claim that they do not have
the problems of confusion, etc.

during a long run, even the 100-mile runs.

They also claim that their
recovery time is shorter than when they were on a high-carbohydrate intake.

The body cannot store
excess sugars or other carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates are converted to TGs to prevent damage from
high glucose levels.

High blood sugar levels are the cause of most of the diabetic side effects that
cause disabilities in diabetes type 2 (DM2) patients, many of which are caused by inflammation
induced by the sugars.

energy  PreFerences  oF tissues
The myocardium preferentially uses FAs for energy under normal physiological conditions.

However, it can efficiently use ketones as the energy substrate under ketotic conditions.20 Under
conditions of starvation or a chronic ketogenic diet, ketone bodies, lactate, amino acids, or acetate
can be utilized to produce ATP in the heart mitochondria.

Multiple energy sources ensure the con -
tinued functioning of this vital organ.

As discussed above, the preferred energy substrates and metabolic patterns of the brain, skeletal
muscle, cardiac muscle, adipose tissues, and liver are all different and organ specific.

Glucose is the
preferred fuel for the brain in normal, well-fed people in today’s U.S. population on high carbohy -
drate diets.

However, it requires insulin to be able to cross the blood–brain barrier.

Recently, there
has been a report of diabetes—Type 3—diabetes of the brain.

If brain insulin is low, the sugars
cannot enter and conditions like Alzheimer ʼs may develop.

Many normal people who have switched
to a ketogenic diet (one high in fat) report that they feel much better and seem to be thinking more
clearly.

During starvation or low blood sugar states, ketone bodies, especially, acetoacetate and
3-hydroxybutyrate become the main fuel for the brain.

It has been estimated that after 3 days of low
blood sugar, the brain gets 25% of its energy from ketone bodies and after 40 days about 70%.21 At
the beginning of starvation, the brain does not burn ketones as they are an important substrate for
lipid synthesis in the brain.

Other tissues can use fatty acids, protein, etc.

Skeletal muscle can use
glucose, fatty acids, and ketone bodies as fuel depending on the need at the time.

At the beginning
of exercise, and for short “spurts” of energy, the preferred fuel is glucose.

Muscle is able to make
glycogen as a fuel reserve for its own needs.

However, a limited amount of glycogen can be stored
within the muscle.

The glucose in skeletal muscle is converted to pyruvate with the production of
2 ATPs made available for energy.

The pyruvate is then converted to lactate and sent back to the 22 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
liver where the lactate is converted back to pyruvate and with the addition of six phosphates con -
verted back to glucose to go back to the peripheral muscles.

These transformations are called the
Cori cycle.

These transformations are called the
Cori cycle.

This cycle shifts part of the metabolic energy burden back to the liver.

After the first
few minutes of heavy exercise, the ketones and fatty acids become the main energy source as they
can be stored near the muscle cells and are more efficiently utilized.

Marathon runners perform
better on a   ketogenic diet and recover quicker than on a high carbohydrate diet.

The heart muscle
generally runs on ketones provided by the liver because it needs a constant energy supply every
day.

The adipose tissue makes and stores TG from glucose delivered to it when insulin is high and
releases the TG fatty acids when insulin drops.

The liver is multifunctional to support other organs.

It can make and mobilize glycogen to provide other organs.

It also can perform gluconeogenesis
to provide glucose to other organs.

It can synthesize very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) to send
TGs to the adipose for storage.

In the fasting state, these stored TGs are sent back to the liver to be
converted to ketones.

All these varied functions are integrated by hormones and metabolic signals
in a ballet of sorts.

Ketone  bodies
What Are Ketone Bodies?

Ketone bodies are fuel molecules formed from fatty acids.

They are molecules containing car -
bon, oxygen, and hydrogen.

They are not particles, as the name suggests, but just small molecules.

The shorter-chain FAs (butyric, capric, caprylic, decanoic, and lauric) are more easily converted
to ketone bodies.

However, the longer chain ones (palmitic16:0 to ~ 20:0) can also be converted.

Coconut oil which has about 50% shorter-chain FAs is a good source for ketone production.

The
longer-chain unsaturated and polyunsaturated FAs do not yield as much energy per carbon as the
saturated FAs.

The ketones are carried dissolved in the blood plasma and pass directly into the cells
through the cell membrane and into the mitochondria where they are converted to ATP—the energy
currency of the cells.

The three main ketones produced in the mitochondria are acetone, acetoacetic acid, and
β-hydroxybutyric acid.

(Figure 2.1) Acetone is a three-carbon ketone derived from sequential
oxidation of longer chain FAs.

Acetic acid is metabolized to acetone, but in very small amounts.

Sometimes, it can be detected from the breath of people doing a very long fast.

Acetoacetic acid is a
true ketone but beta-hydroxybutyric acid is actually a small carboxylic acid but acts like a ketone for
combustion.

Kidneys usually make their own ketones as they require them for energy.

The liver pro -
vides most of the other ketones for itself and the heart.

The heart can process fatty acids to make its
own energy, but when necessary, the liver will provide ketones for the heart and the rest of the body.20

FIGURE 2.1  Ketone bodies.23 Fats and Cardiovascular Disease
When needed, the liver can supply the water-soluble ketones through the blood to other tissues that
use the acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, which can be converted quickly to acetyl-CoA to pro -
duce energy, using the citric acid cycle.

Individual tissues have the capacity to produce ketones but
it takes a few days of a ketogenic diet for the other tissues to convert to a ketone metabolic currency.

The brain takes a few days and up to 2 or 3 weeks to completely adjust to ketosis.

Prehistorically, the
brain may have always used ketones but with the present-day diets being consumed it usually runs
on glucose.

A condition commonly called “diabetes type 3” has been identified in which the brain
insulin is too low to process adequate glucose for the needed energy of the brain.22 In diseases such
as Alzheimer ʼs, ALS, and Parkinson’s, a ketogenic diet may be useful.

It is interesting to note that the
three major organs necessary to maintain life—kidney, liver, and heart all use ketone as their main
energy source.

Glucose levels can change rapidly during the day but ketones are more constant and
do not depend on regular meals for substrate, because depot fat is constantly available.

Ketone bodies are formed when the glucose levels in the body become low.

This can happen
when the blood sugar becomes low due to low food intake, starvation, heavy exercise, or ingestion
of a ketogenic diet (a diet with more fat than glucose).

Ketosis , due to the ingestion of a ketogenic
diet, is not to be confused with ketoacidosis, which is the result of uncontrolled diabetes and a dan -
gerous medical emergency.

Ketoacidosis is caused by excessive blood glucose and insufficient insu -
lin to lower it, which tends to dehydrate the tissues.

In the presence of low insulin, the adipose tissue
can release FAs to the liver to form ketones for energy production.

As ketone bodies accumulate, the
pH of the blood drops and causes an acidic condition in the presence of ketones— ketoacidosis .

The
presence of high ketones and high blood sugar overwhelms the system and coma and often death
occur.

This is a medical emergency.

The ketotic state is a natural event when the diet is low in carbohydrates, including sugar.

It
occurs when the body runs out of glucose reserves and is forced to make ketone molecules from the
fat reserves to use as fuel.

Some people think that ketosis  was the normal state for humans histori -
cally.

Until grain crops were farmed, grazing was the normal way to obtain food, not gorging as we
do now.

Depending on the area of the world, most people would find a few seeds, nuts, and fruits as
they traveled rather large distances.

If hunting was good, they may share a “kill” with the tribe but
then go back to grazing.

There was likely very little obesity.

Some researchers refer to ketones as “high-octane fuel” compared to carbohydrates.

They pro -
vide more energy to the cells because they have a higher energy of combustion, so each molecule
can provide more energy.

Second, they burn “clean” to carbon dioxide and water with no nitrog -
enous or other waste.

Third, they require less oxygen per unit of energy (ATP).

The ketone currency
for energy also modifies the well-being of the cells by decreasing the generation of free radicals in
the cells and increasing the concentration of glutathione in normal cells, which adds to their ability
to neutralize free radicals from endogenous sources, chemotherapy, radiation, AGEs, and so on.

In addition, mutated cancer cells have an absolute requirement for glucose for energy, and a
ketotic state denies them of their energy source.

aMino acids and Proteins
Proteins and amino acids are not generally used for energy.

In late stages of starvation, proteins
begin to be used for energy.

All known enzymes are proteins.

They enhance reaction rates by as
much as a million fold or more compared to simple chemical transformations.

This is probably
the reason they are not sacrificed to make energy, which also requires several enzymes to convert
from CHO or fat to energy.

There are also carrier proteins that help transport compounds around
in the blood and aide in transporting molecules across cell membranes.

Some of the compounds
transported are oxygen (transported by hemoglobin in blood and myoglobin in muscle).

Iron is
transported by transferrin.

Immune antibodies are proteins produced to defend against specific
viruses and bacteria as well as other foreign substances.

adaptations during starvation are made to minimize protein degradation.

Ketone bodies are formed
from fat, and glucose is decreased as body stores are used up.

After about 30 days of starvation, the
body begins to use its own protein for energy, but it is near the end since protein in the diaphragm
and other essential muscles are used up, and this causes death.

SHORT HISTORY LESSON
Beginning in the 1950s, the public was taught that dietary fat is responsible for the “epidemic” of
heart disease.

This became known as the “Diet-Heart Hypothesis.” It was never proven and signifi -
cantly altered the U.S. diet by promoting reduced intake of all dietary fat and decreased saturated
fat with an increase in polyunsaturated vegetable oils.

Despite all the advice and with many people
adhering to such a diet, the “epidemic” was not significantly slowed.

In the 1980s, there was a
large campaign to severely decrease the total fat and especially the saturated fat in the diet.

This
advice led to the “obesity epidemic” after 1980 (Figure 2.2).

By 1980, the trans  fatty acid content
of the U.S. diet had just about peaked and natural fats such as animal, dairy, and so on were greatly
decreased compared to the 1930s and 1940s.

The “healthy” vegetable oils were greatly increased
due to the decrease in butter and meat fat consumption.

The CHD deaths were not decreased, how -
ever.

The so-called “epidemic” of CHD may not ever have been an epidemic because the ability
to identify CHD early and definitively was greatly increased during these same years.

Diagnostic
techniques and treatments were better and more available.

However, the incidence continued to be
elevated and there was no evidence of abatement despite improved treatments and surgeries.

During the period from 1980 to about 2012, the recommended diets were very high in carbohy -
drates and low in fat, especially natural fats.

The U.S. protein consumption has not changed since
1900 and remains at about 20% of the calories.

Thus, if fat intake is lowered, the carbohydrate
intake will increase.

The diets recommended very low fat intake (20%–30% of calories), which left
50% to 60% cal of carbohydrate (CHO).

The form of the CHO determines the speed with which
it is converted to sugar not the end product.

Sugars are the end product of the digestion of sugar,
flours, grains, whole grains, fiber, and so on.

When CHOs are digested, the body sees a sugar—
usually glucose.

But with fruit ingestion, it may see fructose, especially with sweetened soft drinks
and other products where fructose is used instead of glucose.

The glucose signals the pancreas to
secrete insulin, which stimulates the body to store glucose.

The liver and adipose cannot store too

much sugar or glycogen, so the liver makes TGs out of the sugars.

It also cannot store too much TG
because it causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFL).

Therefore, it makes low-density lipopro -
tein (LDL) to ship the TG out to the body to use as energy.

To make the LDL, it needs not only TG
but also cholesterol, so it makes cholesterol to be able to assemble the LDL to ship the components
to the rest of the body.

Meanwhile, the adipose tissue is making fat from glucose that goes directly
to the adipose tissue where it is stored as TG for future use.

Meanwhile, the adipose tissue is making fat from glucose that goes directly
to the adipose tissue where it is stored as TG for future use.

However, with the high-CHO diet, the
blood sugar seldom gets low enough to allow the insulin levels to decrease to the point that the TG
can leave the depot fat to supply energy to the rest of the body.

Thus we are seeing the “obesity”
epidemic (Figure 2.2).

Fructose has been linked to cardiovascular and DM2 risk factors in teens.

A study in teenagers
found that the ones who consumed higher levels of fructose had a higher risk of cardiovascular
problems than their peers that consumed less.

In addition.

they had increased visceral adiposity,
an additional risk factor for CVD as well as diabetes.23 Fructose is the major sweetener used in
processed foods and drinks.

The adolescents consuming higher levels of fructose displayed higher
levels of risk factors associated with CVD and DM2 including increased systolic blood pressure,
TG, LDL-cholesterol, inflammatory markers, and glucose intolerance.

The authors cite a relation -
ship between abdominal fat and fructose consumption.

This fat pad is metabolically different than
the subcutaneous adipose tissue in thighs and legs.

When the measure of visceral adiposity was
added to the statistical equation, the relationships strengthened, indicating a strong relationship with
the adiposity.

Because of this relationship, the author suggests that fructose may promote visceral
fat accumulation.

This fat pad surrounds the abdominal organs and can release factors associated
with CVD as well as insulin resistance and inflammatory disease.

The relationship was evident in
subjects as young as 14–18 years old.

This observation is consistent with the “obesity” epidemic in
young children since the 1980s (Figure 2.2).

To compound the heart disease problem, the levels of tFAs were at their highest during this
time ( ~1980 +) until the labeling laws took effect and partially hydrogenated oils were decreased
in the diet.

The combination of the industrially produced tFAs and the obesity epidemic com -
pounded the problems for heart disease.

The isomers of tFAs formed naturally in the rumen of
cattle, cows, sheep, and goats are very different from the industrially formed ones.

The shapes
of the molecules, their melting points, and metabolic effects are very different.

The industrially
formed isomers are randomly formed based on the temperature and pressure of the reaction
used to introduce the hydrogen into the double bonds of the FA.

However, the tFAs formed by
the rumen organisms of the animals are directed by enzymes that have specific requirements for
where they will introduce the trans  double bond.

The main tFAs formed is trans- vaccenic acid,
which has the trans  bond at the number 11 position of the 18-carbon FA.

This isomer does not
depress milk fat production and can be formed in our bodies into the 9c,11t- CLA (conjugated
linoleic acid), which is a powerful anticarcinogen.2 The other isomers present are in much smaller
amounts and their effects are not known yet.

However, the industrially formed CLA isomers
are rich in 10t, 12c-CLA, which is toxic to the liver and some reproductive processes as well as
pro-carcinogenic for mammary cancer by accelerating mammary tumorigenesis and stimulating
lung metastasis in a mouse model.3 Also the trans -10 monene is the major one produced when the
hydrogenation proceeds longer.

The trans -10 isomer, significantly ( p < .003), depresses milk fat
in lactating mice as does trans-9 ( p < .01) and vegetable shortening ( p < .002) which is a mixture
of isomers (unpublished data by this author).

Another problem with the TFAs is that during the
hydrogenation process, most of the EFAs are destroyed by being totally hydrogenated or modified
by creating trans  double bonds that are not effective EFAs.

Chemically made trans FAs (tFAi) have been shown to be related to heart disease.

Mensik and
Katan published one of the first studies in 1990.

They demonstrated that increased consumption of
tFAi increased the occurrence of heart disease in their study group.24 The USDA25,26 studies that
followed confirmed many of the changes noted by Katan et al.

More recently, Mozaffarian et al.27
reported that tFAi consumption adversely affects CHD risk factors as well as increased the risk of 26 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
CHD.

Deleterious effects of tFA consumption include increased LDL-C levels, decreased HDL-C
levels, impairment of insulin sensitivity in the presence of insulin resistance, pro-inflammatory
effects, endothelial dysfunction, aberrant PPARg responses, and decreased synthesis of milk fat in
nursing mothers.

An article published in JAMA28 cites evidence that the CVD rates as well as the risk factors have
decreased because of the effect of trans fat labeling.

This is consistent with the original article pub -
lished by Mensik and Katan24 that the commercial tFAs in the U.S. and European food supply were
not beneficial for heart disease.

A study conducted by the USDA has reported that their saturated
fat test diet significantly lowered Lp(a)25 (lipoprotein(a), a highly inflammatory small-particle LDL
with a disulfide bridge).

But a subset, with initially high levels of Lp(a) ( >30 mg/dL), when consum -
ing chemically produced tFAs, responded to the high trans  diet with a 5% increase in Lp(a).

In a
later study,26 they found that C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were higher after consuming
a trans  fat-containing diet than after a carbohydrate rich diet.

The E-selectin concentrations were
higher after the TFA diet than after the CHO or SFA diets.

The FDA estimated the average U.S. consumption of tFAi has decreased from about 4.6 g/  person/
day in the late 1990s to 1.3 g/person/d in 2010.

This amount is about 28% of the earlier intake.

Vesper et al.29 measured a 50% decrease in tFAi.

Part of this discrepancy could be that if a product
has 0.49 g/serving of tFAs, it can be labeled as “trans” is zero.

Combined with the reduction in
serving sizes to allow “zero trans” labeling, a person could eat nearly a gram of tFA by eating two
servings and not be aware that they ate any tFA.

Blood levels probably are a better estimate as they
reflect actual consumption.

nuclear  receP tor transcri Ption Factors  and co-activators
Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors
To understand the impact of certain fatty acids on the metabolism and effects of different types of
fatty acids, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptors (PPARs) and their functions.

The PPARs are nuclear messengers responsible for the
translation of nutritional, pharmacological, and metabolic stimuli into changes in the expression
of genes involved in lipid metabolism .

PPARs are members of the nuclear hormone receptor super -
family that are activated by natural FAs and some xenobiotics and drug ligands.

They are primarily
involved in lipid metabolism by regulating the genes involved but also are involved in adipocyte
differentiation.

Their name is derived from the first member of the family now called PPAR α, which
responds to various compounds that induce peroxisome proliferation.

Dietary tFAs are one of these
compounds.

The other PPARs do not do this.

There are three PPARs ( α, Δ, and γ), which have spe -
cific expression patterns in different tissues and cell types.

The PPAR α increases fatty acid oxidation; the PPAR γ decreases fatty acid oxidation and leads to
storage; and PPAR β has poorly defined roles.

The PPAR α increases fatty acid oxidation; the PPAR γ decreases fatty acid oxidation and leads to

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Most commonly used animal models tend to have high HDL-C compared to humans and very
low LDL-C. Hamsters are an exception to this generalization and carry most of the dietary fat in
the LDL-C fraction of lipoproteins.30 In the case of rabbits and other herbivores, they have never
eaten cholesterol, so probably do not have the metabolic systems to effectively deal with it.

In addi -
tion, it is very likely that the cholesterol added to the experimental diets is oxidized in the process
of formulating the diets, and in storage, because it is unprotected while on the reagent shelf.

The
cholesterol consumed by humans is integral to the tissue cells or milk of the animals consumed,
which conveys a certain degree of protection from oxidation.

There seems to be a general consen -
sus among researchers that the pig is the best model for human coronary and circulatory studies,
but they are more expensive and difficult to use.

Consequently, most research has been done with 27 Fats and Cardiovascular Disease
laboratory animals.

In light of the above considerations, several large-scale human studies have
been and are being conducted.

The Framingham Study is probably the oldest and is still yielding
multigenerational data collected from human subjects.

There are numerous others that have looked
at specific questions about diet, exercise, dietary fats, lifestyles, and genetic makeup as well as
ethnic comparisons.

SUMMARY: THE ROLE OF INFLAMMATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
There is increasing evidence that dietary cholesterol is not the “cause” of CHD.

It is most likely
present in the atheroma plaque as a natural response to inflammation of the artery walls.

Because
cholesterol was easy to measure as early as the 1930s, it was likely detected and blamed for the
plaque because the other components were not known yet or could not be identified and measured.

Dietary cholesterol is a very, very, small portion of the amount made by the liver.

It is estimated
that the liver makes about 5 g per day of cholesterol.

Dietary intake is ~0.3–0.5 g/d, which is 10%
or less of what the liver makes and even less than what the enterohepatic reabsorption recovers from
the intestine.

The enterohepatic pathway is designed to actually conserve cholesterol by reabsorb -
ing bile acids and dietary cholesterol from the gut.

Cholesterol is an “expensive” molecule for the
body to synthesize (30 carbons and many enzyme reactions) and also a critical one for the proper
functioning of cell membranes, wound healing, brain synapse function, nutrient absorption, steroid
hormones, and so on.

The omega-6 FAs are known to be more proinflammatory than the omega-3 FAs.

As discussed
above, they are at very high levels in the U.S. diets and the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids
is way out of line with the omega-6s being excessively high.

A recent article in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology31 commented that “Atherosclerosis is
a complex inflammatory disease that results from lipid accumulation and oxidation in the arterial
wall combined with an active inflammatory reaction involving transmigration of monocytes and
other inflammatory cells from the blood stream into the vessel wall.”
The Men ʼs Health Study32 reported that the level of CRP, an inflammatory marker that was
measured at the beginning of the study, was significantly related to the risk of future MI by the end
of the study.

Their conclusions were that (1) baseline levels of inflammation, as measured by CRP,
predicts the risk of first MI; (2) CRP is not associated with venous thrombosis; (3) CRP is not a
short-term indicator of risk; and (4) The benefits of aspirin may be modified by underlying inflam -
mation involving both anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects.

Statins, even at low doses, have anti-inflammatory effects.

This may be the real value of statin
treatment, not the lowering of cholesterol.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is also lowered by statins.

CoQ10
is necessary for the electron transport system in mitochondria.

Coenzyme Q10 is a compound made
by all the cells in our bodies.

All the body cells can make it and it is used to produce energy for
all the necessary functions of the cells.

It is essential for the cells ability to make ATP (adenosine
triphosphate), the main energy currency of all the cells.

The ATP is found in all cells and usually is
in the mitochondria associated with the electron transport system that converts the food we eat to
usable energy for growth and maintenance.

It also acts as an antioxidant to protect the body from
oxidative damage.

Statins inhibit the production of CoQ10 and may be the main cause of the bad
side effects people often experience when taking statin drugs.

Because the heart is a muscle that has to work continuously, it does not make much sense to treat
with high doses of a drug that decreases the efficiency of that muscle, as well as others, to work
properly.

This statin-induced decrease in CoQ10 may be related to the muscle pain experienced by
many patients on statin therapy as well as cognitive side effects.

Other important downstream com -
pounds after the HMG-reductase step, which are partially blocked by statins, are also decreased.

These include steroids, bile salts, diolcols, squalene, and so on.

There is increasing evidence that
blood lipids are not the sole determinants of CVD risk, if at all.

About half of the people dying of
heart attacks have normal blood lipids.28 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Low-grade inflammation is a common feature in patients with DM2.

Heart disease, metabolic
syndrome, and DM2 are often comorbidities displayed together and all have increased concentra -
tions of circulatory cytokines, indicating the presence of inflammation.33 Also, atherosclerosis, obe -
sity, and insulin resistance (IR) all are associated with increased cytokines.

These conditions often
appear together in DM2 patients.

Another possible source of inflammation is the presence of latent viruses or bacteria such as
herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Helicobacter pylori , or Chlamydia pneumonia  could be
the initiators of inflammation.

There is some evidence in the literature that they have been identified
with atheroma in the body of patients.

The same species identified in the atheroma were also found
in dental infections for some organisms, especially spirochetes.

CMV infection has been shown
to be associated with CVD.

CMV infection has been shown to cause an increase in arterial blood
pressure in infected mice.

In addition, it has been shown that CMV along with a high cholesterol
diet in mice causes an even higher blood pressure and classic atherosclerotic plaque formation.

Much research is needed to follow-up on these observations.

In a recently published Commentary in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition ,34 we
discussed the saturated fat and cholesterol controversy as well as statin use.

There is a growing lit -
erature that inflammation, not serum cholesterol, is associated with CVD.

High carbohydrate diets
lead to higher levels of inflammation.

Malhotra35 argues in a recent article that saturated fat is not
the issue.

He reports that the LDL-C that increases with saturated fat consumption is the large buoy -
ant (type A) LDL and not the small dense LDL (type B) that is more inflammatory and associated
with CVD.

This type B-LDL is associated with and responsive to carbohydrate intake and not with
the saturated fat intake.

CONCLUSIONS
We have not made a lot of progress in preventing CHD.

This type B-LDL is associated with and responsive to carbohydrate intake and not with
the saturated fat intake.

CONCLUSIONS
We have not made a lot of progress in preventing CHD.

Treatment options such as surgery, stents,
and diagnoses have improved but dietary advice has not contained or even improved the incidence
of CVD to any extent.

Perhaps, it is time to step back and look at the big picture.

It is obvious that
the Diet/Heart Hypothesis is just that—a hypothesis.

A recent study by Chowdhury et al.36 of a meta-analysis of studies totaling 659,298 subjects
through 2013, concluded that “Current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guide -
lines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total
saturated fats.” The only obvious fatty acid group that appeared to increase risk was the tFAs that
produced a relative risk of 1.16 (1.05 – 1.27).

Total long-chain omega-3 FAs decreased the relative
risk to 0.93.

The other groupings had a relative risk of 0.99 to −1.0.

Perhaps, it is time that we step back and look at the big picture and begin to consider some of the
less popular theories about CVD and test them.

Inflammation is one factor that has quite a bit of evi -
dence in its favor.

Likewise, omega-3 FA intake has good scientific evidence not only for alleviating
CVD but also for improved mental function.

The consumption of omega-3 FAs in the United States
is much less than the omega-6s.

There is quite a bit of evidence that SFAs are not causing CHD.

In
fact, the level of fat in the diet is probably not the problem either.

Since the dietary recommendations
in 1980, the obesity epidemic has increased due to the high carbohydrate consumption.

Why not
blame carbohydrates or fructose drinks?

Although the overconsumption of industrial trans fats and omega-6s will bolster inflammatory
responses, the saturated, monounsaturated, and the omega-3 fats offer protection in  cardiovascular
disease.

Saturated fats should no longer be vilified as they are the most resistant to oxidation.

Making smart choices will include utilizing fats that are the most productive and omitting fats that
are the most destructive.

Thus, the discernment of fats is crucial.

We must strongly utilize omega-
3s and olive oil/MUFA (the good) and use less of the omega-6 (the bad) and avoid at all costs the
industrial trans fats (the ugly) as a nutritional strategy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.29 Fats and Cardiovascular Disease

3Has Statin Therapy
Been Oversold?

A Call for a Reevaluation of
the Standards for Treatment*
Stephen T. Sinatra and Jonny Bowden
In Chapter 1, we discussed what we have colloquially referred to as “The Great Cholesterol Myth,”
defined as a belief system based on a collection of deeply intertwined hypotheses about cholesterol,
saturated fat, heart disease, and treatment.

The origins of this belief system can be found in the
“Lipid Hypothesis,” which holds that high cholesterol in the blood leads to heart disease, and the
“Diet-Heart Hypothesis,” which further postulates that saturated fat in the diet is the major cause
of elevated serum cholesterol and, therefore, by definition, a causal actor in the development of
heart disease.

Accepting these notions about fat and cholesterol invariably leads to two conclusions:
(1) saturated fat has little place in a healthy diet and (2) high cholesterol needs to be treated.

The Diet-Heart Hypothesis holds that saturated fat in the diet and, in some versions of the
hypothesis, dietary cholesterol are major contributors to heart disease.

And though there have
always been naysayers who felt that the decision to blame heart disease on saturated fat and choles -
terol was both premature and unwarranted, their warnings went largely unheeded.1 The Diet-Heart
Hypothesis was largely accepted by major health organizations.

Saturated fat became the demon
in our diet.

Even today, the American Heart Association recommends getting no more than 7% of
calories from saturated fat2 and the USDA’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2010) recommends
no more than 10%.3 Meanwhile, cholesterol-lowering drugs became a cash cow for their makers—
particularly Pfizer, whose Lipitor was the best-selling drug of all time, generating, according to
Forbes magazine, global sales of $141 billion, nearly double that of its closest competitor on their
list of best-selling drugs.4
The demonization of saturated fat was accompanied by an even more virulent war on choles-
terol in general.

The National Cholesterol Expert Panel, Adult Treatment Panel III treatment rec -
ommendations targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as an entity to be treated
aggressively by the use of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors
(statins) was launched in 2001.

One in six American adults could potentially be advised to take these
drugs, at a cost of approximately 30 billion a year.5 In 2004, the therapeutic guidelines emphasized
reaching a more targeted LDL level.

below 100 mg/dL or optimally, for very high risk patients, to below 70 mg/dL.6 For more than a
decade, the doctrine and established medical dogma were to get lower and lower LDL levels.

The demonization of saturated fat was made complete with a Time  magazine cover showing two
eggs and a strip of bacon making the shape of a frowning face with the headline “And now the bad
news: Cholesterol.” Food companies started switching to hydrogenated vegetable oils (because any -
thing was “better” than saturated fats); no-fat foods became all the rage; and a multibillion-dollar
pharmaceutical industry developed around lowering the molecule said to be at the heart of the
problem—cholesterol, which was widely believed to be raised by saturated fat.

This perception, and
the idea that “saturated fat and cholesterol clog your arteries,” became what would now be called a
cultural “meme,” and we are still living with it today, despite the fact that it is wildly past its expira -
tion date and simply not supported by the evidence.

Again in Chapter 1, we discussed the first of these, and what we believe to be serious flaws in the
argument against saturated fat.

We discussed the paucity of evidence for the “dangers” of saturated
fat, and the emerging research that absolves dietary saturated fat of a causal role in heart disease.7,8
And we discussed our deepening understanding of the relationship between “high cholesterol” and
heart disease, a relationship far more nuanced and variable than is widely believed.

In this chapter, we will turn our attention toward statin therapy, which is widely considered first-
line therapy for high cholesterol.

But before we can even have a productive discussion about treat -
ment options for dyslipidemia—treatment options that should most certainly include statin drugs,
albeit perhaps in a much more circumscribed way—we should first clarify how we are quantifying
dyslipidemia in the first place.

What exactly does “high cholesterol” mean, and what is its signifi -
cance?

Though it may seem like those questions have been long settled, the truth is that they are not.

In this chapter, we will make the case for a fresh evaluation of the accepted criteria for statin therapy
and for a fresh evaluation of the efficacy (and potential dangers) of the therapy itself.

One of the many “great cholesterol myths” we have called attention to concerns the very nature
of the measurements on which most physicians base their recommendations for statin therapy.

High-density lipoproteins (HDL) and LDL are not two distinct classes of homogeneous molecules,
rendering obsolete the commonly used division of cholesterol into “good” (HDL) and “bad” (LDL).

A more sophisticated and complete assessment of cholesterol subclasses has been available for some
time, and in our opinion, should always be used preferentially to the cruder measurement (high
cholesterol), which may not, and frequently does not, correlate with risk.

For example, while most HDL is, in fact, beneficial, it is suggested that HDL2 is more protective
than HDL3.9 The importance of LDL subtypes is even more significant.

LDLs have two distinct
subtypes, LDL-a and LDL-b, both of which look and behave quite differently in the body.

44,"Chunk 44:
LDLs have two distinct
subtypes, LDL-a and LDL-b, both of which look and behave quite differently in the body.

LDL-a
is a large, fluffy molecule with less potential for atherogenic mischief, whereas LDL-b is quite the
opposite—a small, dense, molecule that brings with it the potential for significant  inflammation
and ultimate vascular injury.

Those with a preponderance of LDL-a particles (i.e., Pattern A) have a
significantly different risk profile than those with a preponderance of LDL-b particles (Pattern B).10
Particle size distribution should certainly be taken into account when determining whether a
patient’s cholesterol levels are of concern or not.

Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that overall particle number is a far better predictor of
coronary events than LDL alone.11 Yet, most prescriptions for statin drugs have been written on the
basis of overall LDL numbers, the crudest and least revealing of the available cholesterol tests.

As
we will see in this chapter, these drugs are very far from universally benign.

Every effort should be
made to ensure that they are prescribed only to people who are most likely to benefit from them.

The current tests for cholesterol do not allow us to make that distinction effectively.

In Chapter 4,
Dr. Richard Delany meticulously takes cholesterol and lipid subfraction testing to the next level ,
offering opinions that may seem a bit contrary to this chapter.

Although the cholesterol theory of
heart disease remains controversial and poorly understood by many health professionals, we will
attempt to sort out this confusion by giving the reader the opportunity to see multiple sides of the
cholesterol dilemma.33 Has Statin Therapy Been Oversold?

Although we are often accused of being antistatin, the truth is far more nuanced.

To paraphrase
Shakespeare, we come not to bury statins—but neither do we come to praise them, nor to misrep -
resent their benefits.

We believe statins have a place in treatment.

But emerging evidence suggests
that the side-effect profile of statins is considerably more serious than statin advocates would have
us believe, while their benefits have been wildly oversold.12,13
This has happened for three reasons:
1.

The relatively modest beneficial effect of statin drugs for middle-aged males with existing
cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been exaggerated.14
2.

The assumption that because benefits have been observed in high-risk middle-aged men on statin
medication for secondary prevention, those benefits would accrue to the general population.

3.

The underreporting by physicians of the considerable side-effect profile of statin
medication.13
We are deeply concerned that these drugs are now being enthusiastically recommended for pop -
ulations in which they have shown no appreciable benefit (women, primary prevention, the elderly)
and in which they may reasonably be expected to do quite a bit of potential harm (children).

Does this mean statins should never be used?

Of course, not.

Any good physician will use a
drug—even one with potential side effects—if the risk of not using the drug is greater than the risk
of using it.

But she will not  do so if the benefit is likely to be minimal, whereas the potential for dan -
ger is moderate to substantial.

All of us would take a drug that would reduce our risk of cancer by
25% if the only side effect were a small chance of getting the temporary sniffles.

But would we take
a drug that might  reduce the risk of a cold, but would likely cause a significant increase in the risk
for bladder cancer?

Most of us would consider this a bad bargain—a lot of risk for very little reward.

If a given drug was the only thing standing between any of us and a life-threatening disease, and if
the benefit of that particular drug were significant and demonstrable, we might be willing to take
a chance.

Yet, if the benefits of that drug had been oversold to us, while the risks had been largely
underpublicized—or, worse, hidden in plain sight—we (both patients and doctors) would be unable
to make an informed decision based on an accurate analysis of the “risk/benefit” ratio.

And that is precisely the situation we find ourselves in today vis-à-vis statin drugs.

Although there
have certainly been drugs with a far worse side-effect profile than statins (thalidomide, for one), the
fact exists that statins have a number of potential and serious side effects, including muscle pain,
fatigue, loss of libido, and everything from mild memory loss to transient global amnesia.

Some statin
studies have also shown a disturbing elevation in the risk for diabetes15 and, in some research, can -
cer.16,17 In one study, statin use was actually associated with an increased risk of death.18 In that study,
in a population of 300 adults diagnosed with heart failure and followed for an average of 3.7 years,
those who were taking statins and had the lowest levels of LDL were found to have the highest rates
of mortality.

(Conversely, those with the highest levels of cholesterol had a lower risk of death.)

And,
as we will see shortly, few, if any, studies show a benefit to statin users in all-cause mortality, mean -
ing the notion of taking a statin drug to extend your life is simply unsupported by any real evidence.

Would not it, therefore, make good sense to know precisely who will benefit the most from these
drugs (and who is unlikely  to benefit) before prescribing them willy–nilly to virtually every person
over 40 on the assumptions that (1) they are completely benign substances that will never harm
anyone and (2) that they actually save lives?

Furthermore, although statins do, as mentioned, have a modest beneficial effect for secondary
prevention in middle-aged men, it is widely assumed (and unquestioned in the mainstream media)
that they accomplish this modest benefit primarily by lowering cholesterol levels.

But what if this
were not true?

What if, in fact, statins produced any positive effect that they produced despite  the
fact that they lowered cholesterol, not because of it?

Here is an example: cherries are widely known to have compounds in them (anthocyanadins) that
reduce inflammation, and are effective at reducing pain, particularly from gout.

Imagine a primitive 34 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
society that discovered this relationship, but then wrongly concluded that “red foods cure gout.”
Their observation that cherries have demonstrable healing properties might be spot on, but they
would be guilty of making a false attribution , by ascribing the healing properties of cherries to their
“redness.” The observation  would be correct but the explanation  would be wrong, and following
the “red foods cure gout” theory would be expected to produce some miserable failures (except, of
course, when the red food in question happens to be cherries!).

What if the same situation existed with statin drugs?

The observed benefit (modest though it is)
with statin drugs is attributed  to their ability to lower cholesterol, just as cherries’ ability to lower
inflammation might be wrongly attributed to their red color.

But what if the real reason for statin
benefit lies elsewhere, just as the real benefit of cherries has little to do with their color?

Would not
it be important to know that?

We believe that the benefit of statin drugs in middle-aged men with existing heart disease may
come from the well-known ability of statins to lower inflammation and to thin the blood.19 If this
is so, and if the negative side effects of statins are in fact related only to their cholesterol-lowering
activity, this information would be extremely valuable.

It would let the drug manufacturers develop
a much safer statin- like drug that simply attacked inflammation and platelet aggregation and left
cholesterol lowering and the side effects that come with it alone.

But that is not going to happen as long as we continue to fervently believe the cultural meme that
cholesterol causes or is in some direct  way responsible for heart disease, and that statins “work”
because they lower cholesterol.

The argument that the “value” of statins comes from something other  than their cholesterol-
lowering activity is given quite a bit of weight by an analysis of the cholesterol-lowering studies that
took place prestatin drugs.

If cholesterol lowering reduces the risk of heart disease, then you would
expect to see that effect regardless of the method used to lower cholesterol, provided, of course, that
the method did not involve some diabolical, unsafe, and medically unsound procedure.

Well, as it turns out, there were a good 16 studies on lowering cholesterol well before statins
became the front runner as a first-order treatment for the “medical” condition of high cholesterol.

These 16 studies were brilliantly analyzed by two researchers: Russell Smith, PhD, an American
experimental psychologist with a strong background in physiology, math, and engineering, and
Edward Pinckney, MD, the editor of four medical journals and former coeditor of the Journal of the
American Medical Association .20
Smith and Pinckney reviewed all the cholesterol-lowering trials that had been done before 1991.

The studies found that using drugs to lower cholesterol was quite effective.

The problem was that
they were not much good for anything else.

If cholesterol lowering was an effective way to reduce
the risk of heart disease and death, then we would expect the research to show a reduction in heart
attacks, strokes, and deaths when cholesterol was effectively lowered.

However, this is not what
happened.

Smith and Pinckney: “Drugs were used to lower blood cholesterol levels in twelve trials.

Eight of these trials were both randomized and blinded.

Of the eight that met this standard, total
deaths in six trials were the same or greater in the treatment group than in the control group.

For the
remaining four trials (either nonrandomized or unblinded), there were no differences between the
treatment group and the control group.”20
So, if lowering cholesterol does not make a big difference, as the overwhelming majority of these
16 studies showed, but statin drugs, which also lower cholesterol, are making a big difference (as
the manufacturers and marketing departments of these drugs love to keep telling us), then logically,
the benefit of statin drugs cannot  be due to their cholesterol lowering ability, and has to be due to
something else.

We believe the number one candidate for that “something else” is the ability of statins to lower
inflammation.

Which might lead to the reasonable question, “so what?” If statins lower inflamma -
tion and are essentially safe drugs with little downside, what is the problem?

(Indeed, some doctors
with big media platforms and best-selling popular books are going on talk shows waxing eloquently
about statins, stopping just short of suggesting that they be added to the water supply.

)2135 Has Statin Therapy Been Oversold?

There are two main problems with using statins as a first-line therapy against inflammation and,
ironic and counterintuitive as it may seem, the first of those problems is that statins actually lower
cholesterol.

And that may turn out to be a very dangerous situation for the brain.

And that may turn out to be a very dangerous situation for the brain.

“When cholesterol levels are low,” writes neurologist David Perlmutter, MD, “the brain simply
doesn’t work well, and individuals are at a significantly increased risk for neurological problems
as a consequence.”22 One of the fundamental roles of the much-maligned LDL molecule, which, of
course, is not cholesterol per se, but a lipoprotein, is to transport cholesterol to the neuron where
it performs important functions.

But, when free radicals or sugar damage the LDL molecule, its
ability to deliver cholesterol to the brain is compromised.

Oxidized LDL, as opposed to native,
unoxidized LDL, is emerging as a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis.

Hence, as Perlmutter
points out, we should put our efforts into reducing the risk of LDL oxidation,  not necessarily reduc -
ing levels of LDL itself.

That there could be collateral damage resulting from indiscriminate cholesterol lowering is an
emerging concern.

Depression runs much higher in people with low cholesterol.23 Elderly men with
low cholesterol have a 300% higher risk of depression than their cohorts with high cholesterol,24
whereas in a sample of 300 healthy women, depression was also significantly higher among those
in the lowest cholesterol group.25 Lower cholesterol (under 160) is associated with a significantly
greater likelihood of suicide,26 with a significantly greater likelihood of external-cause mortality,27
and with a 350% increase in the risk for Parkinson’s.28
The second problem with using statins as a first-line therapy against inflammation is that it is
simply inefficient.

There are far more benevolent ways to accomplish the same goal, with far less
potential for mischief.

It is certainly worth exploring whether a greater anti-inflammatory effect can
be had at considerably less economic cost and with none of the potential side effects of statins from
pharmaceutical-grade fish oil, either as a stand-alone intervention or as part of a decidedly nontoxic
cocktail of known anti-inflammatories such as curcumin and resveratrol.

If lowering inflammation
is the real benefit of statins, and that benefit could be had with less risk for less money, would not
it be important to know that?

And if the main benefit from statins is in fact their ability to lower
systemic inflammation, why continue to use a potentially dangerous medicine to accomplish that
which can be accomplished with a few weekly servings of salmon or a daily supplement of omega-3
fatty acids?

A careful examination of the research suggests that statins do whatever good they do indepen -
dently of their ability to lower cholesterol.

The Heart Protection Study (HPS)29 evaluated women,
the elderly, diabetics, people with low baseline cholesterol levels, and those with prior occlusive non -
coronary vascular disease.

Results demonstrated the positive impact of Simvastatin therapy across
all patient groups, independent  of cholesterol levels.

Even in subjects with acceptable LDL-C levels
(<100 mg/dL), there was a clear reduction in the incidence of major cardiovascular events, suggest -
ing that risk reduction for CVD is not the result of the ability of HMG-CoA to reduce LDL-C level.

In other words, cholesterol is found at the scene of the crime but is it the perpetrator?

Statins
lower circulating lipoproteins, but they have multiple pleotropic and antiatherogenic effects as
well.30 The researchers in the WOSCOPS Study19 indicated that the positive impact of statins had
more to do with their favorable properties on blood rheology and blood viscosity.

In the Jupiter
Study,31 there was a 53% reduction in venous thromboembolism and the abrupt withdrawal of statins
in the setting of unstable angina or acute coronary syndrome could be hazardous and even fatal.

We
have learned that statins should be strictly avoided in any situation of a central nervous system bleed
as demonstrated by the Massachusetts General Hospital researchers.32 Clearly, statins at some level
are thinning the blood and will be especially protective in the setting of acute ischemia or in very
high-risk men as demonstrated in the WOSCOPS Study.19
Perhaps the ENHANCE33 trial put the major nail in the coffin of the cholesterol theory of heart
disease.

The ENHANCE Study became a highly controversial issue given the fact that the study
concluded in early 2006, but the release of its results was delayed until early 2008.

This delay
caused considerable angst in the medical community.

The ENHANCE Study enrolled 720 patients 36 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
with familial hypercholesterolemia who were randomized to receive either a statin drug Zocor
(Simvastatin) or the anticholesterol drug Vytorin (which consists of Zocor plus ezetimbe—a drug
that blocks cholesterol absorption from the gut).

The trial was expected to demonstrate that patients
on Vytorin would have less plaque expansion than patients taking Zocor alone.

For those who
believed that cholesterol is the main cause of coronary heart disease (CHD), ENHANCE was con -
structed not to fail.

The administration of two drugs with different mechanisms of action in the
same patient resulted in a drastic reduction of cholesterol levels but significant reductions in LDL
levels achieved with both Zocor (41%) and Vytorin (58%), artherosclerosis progressed as the mea -
surement in carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) increased in both groups.

These surprising and very disappointing data might be the reason why the results of ENHANCE
were hidden from the medical community for nearly 2 years.

How important is lowering cholesterol
when a drastic reduction resulted in an increase in plaque of the carotid vessels?

After multiple cholesterol-lowering drug trials, the emergence of new data has raised new and
provocative questions.

Dr. Michel de Lorgeril, the architect of the Mediterranean Diet for secondary
prevention, has called for a full reappraisal of the cholesterol theory.34 He points out that major trials
published after the enforcement of clinical trial regulations put in place by the FDA in 2008/2009
following the Vioxx affair were either negative or disappointing.

In 1994–2004, there were highly positive trials with statins that were used to issue guidelines for
medical practitioners.

de Lorgeril is asking for a reappraisal of these studies by experts independent
from the pharmaceutical industry.

In other words, will these earlier trials hold up to scientific scru -
tiny following a reexamination of the data?34
Debates over the cholesterol theory of heart disease and the merits of statin therapy in primary
prevention will continue to go on indefinitely.35 Both opponents and proponents will cite cherry-
picked studies to support their arguments.

But if the studies are exaggerated, flawed, not credible,
or unethical, how are we to arrive at reasonable conclusions?

What about the unpublished negative
studies that do not support the pharmaceutical agenda?

And when the rules are being made by those
with conflicts of interest, the guidelines may be tarnished.

The recent newly developed guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American
Heart Association has now created a policy that could double the number of patients taking statins
in the United States.

These organizations are suggesting that statins should be taken by both men
and women with coronary artery disease (CAD), all subjects with type 1 and type-2 diabetes, as well
as all individuals with LDL cholesterol levels greater than 190 and in those having a heart attack
risk of greater than 7.5% over a 10-year period.36 These guidelines appear to be a gross oversimpli -
fication and puts patients into jeopardy by creating standard of care algorithms for doctors placing
patients on statin drugs.

Most troubling of all is the fact that the risk calculator used to calculate the
target figure of 7.5% risk over a 10-year period was found to overpredict risk by 75%–150%!37—
which led to a critical editorial in The Lancet38 suggesting that the risk prediction algorithm used in
the guidelines “systematically overestimated” cardiovascular risks could therefore lead to overtreat -
ment of a substantial fraction of the 33 million Americans potentially affected by the guideline.

The
Lancet  called for careful reanalysis before the new guideline goes into effect.39
Those of us who have used statins in clinical situations can all agree that statins are powerful
drugs and can be a blessing or a curse.

It makes good sense to use a statin in any male under the
age of 75 with CAD.

Ridker and Wilson40 clearly state: “In 2013, the continued use of absolute risk
assessment to guide prescription will most likely over treat many who do not benefit and undertreat
many for whom efficacy is certain.” And, we believe, that is a male with documented coronary
disease regardless of his cholesterol level as the benefits clearly surpass the risks!

However, women
will need to be treated on an individual basis as the efficacy of statins in women is not as certain as
in men and the risk profile is more significant and substantial in women.41
Recently, a trial in women 55–75 years of age on a 10-year or more statin treatment had more
than double risk of lobular and ductal breast carcinoma.17 And the recent data on increased cataracts
with statins is also alarming suggesting a caution in low-risk populations.42,43 Although it can seem 37 Has Statin Therapy Been Oversold?

reasonable to treat an LDL over 190 in a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia, autosomal
dominant (1 in 500 cases), it is not smart medicine to prescribe statins to every patient with an
LDL greater than 190 or is it reasonable to treat all diabetics and especially those without CAD.

For example, statins in diabetic males may accelerate coronary artery calcification44 and statins can
increase cataracts that are more prevalent in diabetics as well.

And the Women’s Health Initiative
showing an age-adjusted increase of 48% risk of diabetes in postmenopausal females receiving
statins is disconcerting.45 Previously, another meta-analysis of statin trials46 showed new onset dia -
betes occurring frequently in the statin group.

There are safer lifestyle, dietary and nutraceutical
supports that can be used in the insulin-resistant or type-2 diabetic patient.

For example, the modification of lifestyle changes was particularly effective in preventing type-2
diabetes as the incidence of diabetes was reduced by 58% with lifestyle interventions and 31% with
the pharmaceutical drug metformin as compared to placebo in a study of 3234 patients.47 The supe -
riority of a 7% loss of weight with a 150-minute brisk walking program per week showed almost
twice the efficacy over pharmaceutical therapy.47 Other nutraceutical supports that have recently
been popular in treating blood sugar include pycnogenol48 and benfotiamine for advanced glycation
end products49,50 as well as diabetic retinopathy.51 In addition, a Mediterranean dietary pattern rich
in extra-virgin olive oil has been recently proved to significantly reduce the incidence of new-onset
cases of type-2 diabetes in the primary prevention PREDIMED randomized trial.

This finding
represents first-level evidence to support the beneficial effects of a high-quality dietary pattern on
insulin resistance.52
Clearly in any diabetic patient, it makes sense to use pharmaceutical therapies only when nec -
essary and certainly choose safer options as statins in the diabetic, as we have seen, can create
significant adverse effects.

Unfortunately, statin side effects are grossly underreported and may
cause serious harm41; and in some instances, statins caused multiple deaths when cerivastatin was
abruptly removed from the world market.53
Patient complaints about possible side effects must be listened to as statins have the power to lit -
erally form or deform a person’s life.

How do we protect low-risk populations of people, especially
women, the elderly, and children from the unnecessary use of statins?

There is little justification for
subjecting any very low-risk population to the strong possibility of adverse effects if the evidence
does not justify the expectation of benefits outweighing the risks.41 Physicians must be more com -
passionate and listen carefully when the patient is voicing side effects however subtle they may be.

There are going to be gray areas where the physician may be confused about choosing a statin,
particularly in primary prevention.

The assessment of risk is a subjective situation involving dietary
habits, emotional stress, overweight status, hypertension, family history, diabetes, smoking, meta -
bolic syndrome traits, and so on.

Although there will be high-risk patients treated with lifestyle fac -
tors, anti-inflammatory diets, hypertensive control, cessation of smoking, healing emotional stress,
detoxification, and taking targeted nutritional supplements, some patients, and especially those with
low HDL, with higher risk profiles, should be treated with low-dose statins in combination with life -
style improvements.

The most recent meta-analyses showing a reduction of cardiovascular events in
individuals at lower cardiovascular risk requires more scrutiny when considering statin therapy.54,55
However, treating low-risk patients for primary prevention will cause us to pause because the haz -
ards of type-2 diabetes,15,46 adverse quality of life,41,56 and hemorrhagic stroke57 will need to be
considered in the strategic care of the patient.55 Patients who cannot tolerate statins because of
intolerable side effects can use other options.

Important scientific information and clinical studies have defined the present role of natural
agents in the management of inflammation and dyslipidemia.

There are multiple nutraceuticals that
can have a positive impact on inflammatory cytokines and lipid markers, which can help to ease
carotid intimal medial thickness and obstruction, plaque progression, coronary artery calcium score
by electron beam tomography (EBT), generalized atherosclerosis, and endothelial function.

Niacin,
omega-3 essential fatty acids, and Citrus bergamia , to mention a few, may have favorable effects on
HDL, triglycerides (TGs), blood sugar, and LDL particle size and particle number.58–6238 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Niacin has a dose-related effect (1–3 g/day) in reducing total cholesterol (TC), LDL, apolipopro -
tein B (APO-B), LDL particle number, TGs, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), increasing LDL
size from small type B to large type A, and increasing HDL, especially the protective and larger
HDL 2b particle and apolipoprotein (APO-A1).59,63
Niacin inhibits LDL oxidation; increases TG lipolysis in adipose tissue; increases APO-B deg -
radation; reduces the fractional catabolic rate of HDL-APOA-1; inhibits platelet function; induces
fibrinolysis; decreases cytokines, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs); lowers Lp(a), increases adiponec -
tin; and is a potent antioxidant.58,61,62 The niacin dose should be gradually increased, administered
at meal time, pretreated with an 81-mg aspirin and taken with apple pectin to reduce flushing.58 The
effective dosing range is 500–3000 mg/day.

Only vitamin B3 niacin is effective in dyslipidemia.

The non-flush niacin (inositol hexanicotinate—IHN) does not improve lipid profiles and is not rec -
ommended.58 The side effects of niacin include hyperuricemia, gout, hepatitis, flushing, rash, pruri -
tis, hyperpigmentation, hyperhomocysteinemia, gastritis, ulcers, bruising, tachycardia, palpitations,
and hyperglycemia.

Niacin is not recommended in the diabetic population.

Although the side effects
can be unpleasant, the flushing and pruritis can cause discontinuation of the supplement.

However,
if the doses are slowly and gradually increased without missing doses and taken on a regular basis,
the flushing is minimized.

Observational, epidemiologic and controlled clinical trials for omega-3 essential fatty acids have
shown significant reductions in serum TG, VLDL decreased LDL particle number and increased
LDL and HDL particle size as well as major reductions in all CVD events.58,64–71) The DART trial65
demonstrated a decrease in mortality of 29% in men after MI and the GISSI prevention trial found
a decrease in total mortality of 20%, CV deaths of 30%, and sudden death of 45%.66 The Kuppio
Heart Study demonstrated a 44% reduction in fatal and nonfatal CHD in subjects in the highest
quintile of omega-3 intake compared to the lowest quintile.67 Omega-3 fatty acids reduce CHD pro -
gression, stabilize plaque, reduce coronary artery stent restenosis, and CABG occlusion.58
Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic; lower BP, heart rate; and improve
heart rate variability.58,64 There is a decrease in fatty acid synthesis and an increase in fatty acid
oxidation with consistent weight loss.58 Insulin resistance is improved and there are no significant
changes in fasting glucose or hemoglobin A1C with long-term treatment.72
Citrus bergamia  is an active flavanone polyphenol extract that originates from the coast of
southern Italy.

It has been evaluated in several clinical prospective trials in humans.

In doses of
1000 mg/day, this compound lowers LDL up to 36% and TG up to 39%, increases HDL 40% by
inhibiting HMG CoA reductase, increases cholesterol and bile acid excretion, and reduces reac -
tive oxygen species (ROS), blood sugar, and oxLDL.73,74 The active ingredients include naringin,
neroeriocitrin, neohesperidin, poncerin, rutin, neodesmin, rhoifolin, melitidine, and brutelidine.73,74
This very small sample of nutritional and nutraceutical supplements could be a valid alternative for
patients that are statin intolerant, cannot take other drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia, or in
those who prefer alternative treatments.

To summarize, the saturated fat–cholesterol–statin paradigm will continue to raise more ques -
tions than answers.

To summarize, the saturated fat–cholesterol–statin paradigm will continue to raise more ques -
tions than answers.

Unfortunately, the focus on cholesterol as the cardinal factor in atherosclerosis
will detract from other inflammatory etiologies resulting from excessive sugar/insulin relationships,
trans fatty acids, and overzealous use of omega-6 oils.

Oxidized LDL-C, particle size and number,
and especially Lp(a) are also potent factors causing inflammation at the endothelial level.

Statins are potent pleotropic agents and work in several mechanisms in reducing cardiac risk
including antioxidant status, plaque stabilization, reduction in CRP levels, reduction in inflamma -
tion, as well as having a favorable impact on blood and plasma viscosity.19,75 We need to ask our -
selves the question: How much benefit seen from statins is actually due to cholesterol lowering and
how much benefit is due to some of these other mechanisms?

We know, for example, that in patients
with established CAD, statin prescription reduces subsequent risk even if baseline cholesterol levels
are not substantially elevated.

Although reducing LDL particle size and number may indeed be 39 Has Statin Therapy Been Oversold?

significant, much of the available evidence is consistent with the theory that it is the statins them -
selves that reduce cardiac risk rather than the reduction in cholesterol levels achieved by statins.

Although it will require significant time to sort this out, should we use the precautionary principle
in low-risk populations?

Physicians will need to be more creative in identifying patients with cardio -
vascular risk, making lifestyle changes when necessary while trying to temporize the probability of
a cardiac event.

Certainly, some physicians will be more skilled and thus comfortable than others in
the assessment of such a probability.

In this modern pharmaceutical age, the practice of medicine is becoming less and less of a sci -
ence.

Physicians need to bring back the art of medicine.

Empowering the patient with the right
knowledge is a key element in healing.

Although the use of statins in men and some women with
proven CAD is good medicine, standards, guidelines, and algorithms, will only cause a rush to
judgment and overtreat many low-risk people who will not benefit from statins and be vulnerable to
side effects at the same time.

Choosing statin pharmaceutical drug therapy must be employed with
caution and specifically tailored to complement the patient’s needs.

Physicians should not make
their decisions on dogmatic policies but rather see the guidelines as only a guide and definitely not
use statin drugs to treat cholesterol numbers alone.76,77 We must treat the patient thoughtfully and
choose statin drugs carefully with extreme diligence to avoid side effects.

To use Francis Peabody’s
1927 eloquent78 statement in JAMA—“The most important aspect in the care of the patient, is the
care of the patient.”
As all drugs carry some risk, good medicine asks the question, “who has the most to gain from
this drug, and who has the least to gain from it?” Without knowing the answer to that question, it
is impossible to make a wise decision about whether or not the potential benefit of a medication
outweighs the risk in a given patient.

To summarize, we believe statin therapy is best utilized in any male under the age of 75 with
proven and established CAD.

4Lipid Subfraction Testing
Richard Delany
Why is lipid subfraction testing information included in a book entitled Nutritional Strategies for
Cardiovascular Disease?

How might this information be of help?

When and how could it be helpful
in the discussion of nutritional strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD)?

Lipid subfraction testing helps to identify an individual’s “residual risk” of atherosclerosis by
determining the presence of high-risk lipoproteins.

Patients who are at risk of or who already
have evidence of atherosclerosis benefit from the development and implementation of person -
alized strategies.

To be successful in the personal reduction of cardiovascular risk, physicians
and health-care providers need to possess a keen knowledge of the pathophysiological basis
behind a patient’s specific cardiovascular risk factors.

A working knowledge of the well-accepted
risk reduction studies is also important.

Nutritional strategies are very important and can be successful but are often difficult to
implement and maintain successfully.

However, effective individual implementation should
translate into individual clinical benefit.

Risk factors linked to the causation of CVD can
improve with successful nutritional and lifestyle strategies.

Monitoring the improvement of an
individual’s underlying atherogenic lipoprotein levels is one way to assess the short-term ben -
efits of a nutritional/lifestyle strategy.

If successful, one would predict a future risk reduction
or decreased progression of CVD.

One example of the effect of nutritional strategies in cardiovascular risk reduction is the improve -
ment in lipid subfraction values when patients successfully eradicate metabolic syndrome.

Complex
lipid abnormalities often normalize with the loss of total weight, abdominal fat, and insulin resis -
tance.

A case study will be presented later that is an example of that type of result.

Improvement
in lipid measurements and other risk factors without pharmacological intervention illustrates the
power of successful nutritional strategy.

In summary, lipid subfraction testing can both serve as a way to identify an individual’s “residual
risk” of atherosclerosis and as a measurement of nutritional success.

ATHEROSCLEROSIS
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity and
is a major health problem in the United States and in many countries, accounting for 16.7 million
deaths each year.1 Coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease are the most com -
mon forms of ASCVD.

The lifetime risk of ASCVD is substantial and the condition is often silent,
often striking without warning.

Historically, the primary view of the cause of atherosclerosis was believed to be due to
the passive accumulation of cholesterol into the walls of medium-sized to large blood ves -
sels.

Currently, atherosclerosis is now also felt to be linked to the presence of three main
bodily imbalances: (1) abnormal atherogenic lipoproteins, (2) chronic “sterile” inflammation,
and (3) an enhanced tendency toward forming blood clots.

Of these three predisposing fac -
tors, the cause(s) of the complex and chronic “sterile” inflammation linked to ASCVD remains
unknown.

The specific events linked to the occurrence of an atherosclerotic plaque have been well
described.

The initial event is felt to be a qualitative change in the endothelial cells that cover the
inner surface of arteries.

Especially, small dense and/or oxidized LDL lipoproteins are allowed
to enter and remain within the arterial wall.

The usual protective HDL molecules that are pres -
ent, are either too few in number and/or are dysfunctional in their reverse transport process.

Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL [very low density lipoprotein] and remnant particles) add
to the mix becoming pro-inflammatory contributing to a pro-atherosclerotic state.

Smooth muscle
cells, already present in the intima or arriving from the media portion of the blood vessel wall,
are thought to play a sustaining role in the developing plaque.

Impaired clearance of dead cells
from the intimal wall also contributes to the development of an atherosclerotic plaque.

Monocytes
become pro-inflammatory macrophages, changing from a more healthy M1 type to a less healthy
M2 type.

In addition, different types of T cells also become active pro-inflammatory participants.

The innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and the adaptive immune
system are now understood to play important sustaining roles to the existence of chronic “sterile
inflammation.”2,3
The development of an atherosclerotic plaque is a complex chronic biological event with lipid,
inflammatory, and thrombotic elements.

Modern medicine has begun to understand in great detail
what is happening but still does not clearly understand why it is happening!45 Lipid Subfraction Testing
ASSESSING YOUR PERSONAL RISK OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS
use oF a calculator  and use oF a global  risK Factor  assess Ment
Blood lipid testing results, whether obtained by traditional or specialized subfraction lipid testing,
are used as a way to help assess an individual’s risk of developing future coronary heart disease
(CHD) or stroke.

If an individual already has evidence of atherosclerosis, it becomes more urgent to discover and
treat any modifiable risk factors (and possible causes) that make up the often hidden-from-view
residual risk of another atherosclerotic event.

In asymptomatic individuals, the identification of underlying lipid abnormalities with no history
or clinical evidence of atherosclerosis is helpful to identify the future risk of atherosclerotic events.

Once a patient has been identified as having an increased risk of atherosclerosis, this should trigger
the institution of a personalized strategy with some combination of changes in lifestyle and diet and
the possible addition of nutritional supplements and/or drugs—all designed to safely reduce the risk
of ASCVD.

Such a strategy is crucial to prevent or delay the future occurrence of heart attacks,
peripheral vascular disease, or strokes.

Using an accurate automatic calculator is an easy way to determine an individual’s future
risk of ASCVD.

Three helpful scoring systems: (1) The Reynolds Risk Score, (2) The Canadian
Framingham Risk Score Modification and (3) the Framingham CHD Risk Score.

The calculations from these scoring systems provide an estimate of individual’s risk of developing
a cardiovascular event over the next 10-year period as either low, moderate, or high.

If an individual’s
risk is in the moderate or high category, ideally, there should be a focused implementation of a per -
sonalized combination of changes in lifestyle, diet, and the careful consideration of key nutritional
supplements and/or drugs.

It is important to stress that drugs need not be automatically added espe -
cially in an asymptomatic individual with no prior history of any CVD.

However, if based on a per -
sonalized global risk factor assessment and the use of an accurate calculator, a person is at high risk
of future clinical ASCVD over the next 10 years, the use of a statin should be strongly considered
as an important part of the preventive strategy.

Choose your calculator.

I like the Reynolds the best.

GLOBAL RISK FACTOR ASSESSMENT
clinical  decisions  require  an assess Ment oF individual  risK
A global risk factor approach is an approach that involves the identification of the disease-specific
risk factors associated with the chronic disease in question.

Atherosclerosis is an example of a
chronic disease that responds partially to the identification and treatment of underlying risk factors.4
Once an individual’s risk factors are identified, a treatment plan can be created directed at modifi -
able risk factors.

Such a risk factor approach promotes a personalized integrative approach toward
the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.

When a modifiable risk factor linked to atherosclerosis is identified, the hardest task is often the

When a modifiable risk factor linked to atherosclerosis is identified, the hardest task is often the
ability to achieve the desired target in an individual patient.

This is especially true when it involves
lifestyle changes but is also true in “getting to goal” of various metabolic blood tests and bodily
measurements such as LDL particle number (LDL-P) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP ),
hemoglobin A1c, fasting blood sugar (FBS), body weight, blood pressure levels, and body mass index.46 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Successful achievement of specific endpoints in risk factor modification clearly requires focus
and commitment by both the patient and the physician.

My list of atherosclerotic risk factors (Figure 4.1) contains both officially accepted risk  factors and
also members that have not been universally accepted as “group-associated” risk factors.

However,
these “unofficial” risk factors possess biological plausibility and may contribute to the development
of atherosclerosis in individual patients.

In 2011, the National Lipid Association summarized their
recommendations regarding lipid subfraction testing and other markers that are on my list below.5
Lipid subfraction testing is becoming increasingly accepted as an important part of a global risk
factor assessment in patients at risk of atherosclerosis.

Most importantly, the results of lipid subfrac -
tion testing often lead to modifications in the specific treatment plan addressing dyslipidemia risk
in individual patients.

ATHEROSCLEROSIS
How do statins  worK to reduce  ascvd r isK?

Lipid lowering and inflammation reducing—These are the two mechanisms of how statin drugs
reduce an individual’s risk of a heart attack or stroke.

Statins block a key enzyme in the mevalonate
pathway (Figure 4.2).

This leads to a reduction in downstream compounds with an important branch
point seen at farnesyl pyrophosphate.

From that point, cholesterol production occurs on one side and
prenylated protein production occurs on the other.

A reduction in cholesterol production stimulates
a liver receptor to take more cholesterol out of the bloodstream.

A reduction in prenylated proteins
causes inflammation associated with arteries in the body to diminish.

Most of the side effects seen
with statins appear to occur due to a reduction in prenylated proteins.

When a patient takes a statin drug, both parts of the downstream mevalonate pathway are
affected.

When a patient takes a statin drug, both parts of the downstream mevalonate pathway are
affected.

Two of the main effects are beneficial: specifically a reduction in the blood level of LDL
cholesterol and a reduction in inflammation.22,23

FIGURE 4.2  Statins work by blocking two pathways: cholesterol and prenylated protein production.48 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
However, some of the effects of statins can be associated with mild symptoms or are actually clini -
cally harmful, e.g., muscle aches, fatigue, memory loss, and mental status changes.

Many of these
symptoms (both the mild and the harmful) typically can come on slowly and insidiously and can be
unappreciated by both the patient and the physician.

As such, physicians need to be keenly aware of
these symptoms and remain vigilant to the discovery of unsuspected clinically relevant statin toxicity.

I consider five issues before starting a patient on a statin who is starting the statin in an outpatient
setting.

(1) I try to normalize an individual’s vitamin D levels before starting a statin, (2) I try to
start at a low dose of the statin (so as not to assault their enzyme systems abruptly) and I then titrate
upward at different speeds monitoring for side effects, (3) I spend time educating the patient about
potential side effects and remain vigilant in monitoring the patient for symptoms and at times the
use of blood tests measuring liver function tests and muscle enzymes (CPK and Aldolase levels),
(4) I carefully consider the choice of water-soluble statins (pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin
(Crestor), pitavastatin (Lialdo), and fluvastatin (Lescol) if the patient or family members have had
a history of statin intolerance, and (5) in selected patients who have already shown intolerance, I
use a water-soluble statin once or twice a week following the patient’s lipid levels and symptoms or
muscle enzyme levels.

There are a number of genetic risk factors that have been identified that can
identify patients at increased risk of statin toxicity.

The SLCO1B1 gene encodes for a protein in liver cells that is responsible for the transport of
statins into the liver cells.

Some common variations in the SLCO1B1 gene are associated with a
reduced ability to process some of the statins resulting in higher blood concentration and higher
muscle tissue exposure.

One statin, fluvastatin, does not require this pathway for entry and would
be an alternate choice of a statin for a patient who has symptomatic muscular complaints with the
presence of the genetic variation.

The statins that use this pathway are atorvastatin,  simvastatin,
rosuvastatin, and pravastatin.

Boston Heart Diagnostics Laboratory includes gene testing for  variants
of SLCO1B1.24
There are 7 possible statins to choose from: pitavastatin, rosuvastatin , fluvastatin, atorvastatin,
simvastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin.

Three of them (simvastatin and lovastatin and to a lesser
extent, atorvastatin) are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4.

The risk of toxic -
ity increases, especially with simvastatin or lovastatin, when they are co-administered with other
CYP3A4 metabolized drugs such as antifungal drugs, erythromycin, colchicine, and two calcium
channel blockers (diltiazem or verapamil).

Phase I oxidation by the cytochrome P450 system (spe -
cifically: CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9) is used by most of the statins except for
pitavastatin (Lialdo), fluvastatin (Lescol), and rosuvastatin (Crestor).

Coenzyme Q10 administration has been historically helpful in some patients who develop
symptoms associated with statin use, but I have found minimal success with the addition of coen -
zyme Q10 allowing patients to then tolerate those statins to which they had previously been intoler -
ant.

Experiments have suggested that providing geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (see Figure 4.2) could
potentially reverse side effects of the statins but unblocking the decreased prenylation pathways
would probably also reverse the beneficial anti-inflammatory element behind statin use.

A coenzyme
Q10 in statin myopathy study25 was begun in 2013.

In this study, the treatment arm receives 600 mg
of Coenzyme Q10 daily, attempting to ensure an adequate tissue dose of coenzyme Q10 is given.

Another common strategy is one of intermittent statin dosing by giving a statin two to three
times a week to minimize symptoms and allow for safe administration of some dose of statin to
receive some of the beneficial effects of LDL reduction and/or inflammation reduction.26,27
Abnormal lipid values are often associated with the presence of inflammation as evidenced by
elevation of blood levels of inflammatory markers such as hsCRP.

Lp-PLA2 represents a test that
when found to be increased, may represent the presence of inflammation.

Another inflammatory
marker is Myeloperoxidase, which is a protein stored in white blood cells and released in response
to inflammation.

There has been some data that supports its ability to identify subclinical ath -
erosclerosis and potentially identify the future risk of a cardiovascular event.

Further studies are
needed to understand the clear clinical and prognostic usefulness of Lp-PLA2 and myeloperoxidase 49 Lipid Subfraction Testing
measurements.

At this time, successful reduction of high-risk lipid values along with the reduction
of hsCRP has been shown in multiple studies to reduce CHD risk on an average of 36% (up to 46%
in diabetic patients).

Even with successful administration of a statin and its ability to lower both the LDL  cholesterol
and hsCRP of patients, there still remains a significant residual risk of CHD.

“The decrease in car -
diovascular mortality due to statin therapy still allows two thirds of cardiovascular events to occur.”28
I believe that while the primary cause(s) of the chronic inflammation are still not  understood, the
use of lipid subfraction testing to help identify and correct an individual’s abnormal lipid subfrac -
tions can reduce residual CHD risk.

LIPID TESTING AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS
Lipoproteins are a group of particles that are responsible for transporting lipids throughout the body.

Each type of lipoprotein contains a combination of protein, cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospho -
lipid molecules.29 There are a number of factors that affect an individual’s concentration and func -
tion of the various lipoproteins.

A dynamic, primarily bloodstream-based process results in daily
modifications of the various lipoproteins as they are able to drop off or pick up different components
in the blood, liver, or other tissues.

Large triglyceride lipoproteins (VLDL) formed by the liver in
response to dietary fat intake are typically modified once they arrive in the bloodstream.

The specific
activity of different enzymes within an individual’s bloodstream and tissues (e.g., lipoprotein lipase
[LPL] and cholesterol ester transfer protein [CETP]) help shape the amount and type of lipoproteins.

Additional modifications of the lipoproteins also occur throughout the day in response to one’s diet,
level of exercise, the presence of insulin resistance, the nature and the degree of any underlying
chronic inflammatory states, and lastly, the individual genetic expression of the individual patient.

A traditional lipid panel testing measures the amount of cholesterol and triglyceride within the
various types of lipoproteins providing a snapshot view of a complex array of lipoproteins that vary
from each other in size, composition and function (Figure 4.3).

The complexity of the various lipo -
proteins are better understood by realizing that they are made up of a number of different elements:
chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, VLDL (triglyceride) particles (total, large, and small), LDL
particles (total, large, intermediate, and small), Lp(a), and HDL particles (total, large, medium and

)50 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
All the high-risk atherogenic lipoproteins (VLDL, IDL [intermediate-density lipoprotein], LDL,
and Lp(a)) have in common the presence of one molecule of apolipoprotein B. Apolipoprotein B
levels (apoB) and the LDL particle number (LDL-P) currently represent two available tests that
accurately provide a direct measurement of atherogenic particles31 and are superior to the tradition -
ally measured LDL cholesterol level (LDL-C).

Although a non-HDL cholesterol level (non-HDL-C) is better at determining the presence of
residual atherogenic particles missed by a traditionally measured LDL-C, it does not accurately mea -
sure the total level of atherogenic particles32,33 that measurements of apoB and LDL-P both provide.

As such, some residual risk of CHD can be missed by relying solely on a non-HDL-C measurement.

ApoB levels are readily available in many commercial laboratories and medical centers using a
number of different methodologies.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  measurement of LDL-P
may actually be more precise than apoB, but the real advantages of NMR over apoB is the ability
of the NMR LipoProfile to provide more information about the other major lipoprotein classes,32
especially the level of small dense LDL, the total HDL-P, the large HDL, and the large VLDL.

WHY LIPID SUBFRACTION TESTING?

• To obtain an accurate measurement of an individual’s atherogenic lipoproteins
• To better assess potential clinical risk
• To assess successful improvement of high risk lipoproteins after treatment
A significant degree of “residual risk”28 exists in many patients after being treated with statins as
evidenced in the major stain trials (Figure 4.4).34 Residual risk is found particularly in patients with
insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

In 2008,35 a “residual risk reduction initiative”
was formed to focus specifically on a plan to treat the common atherogenic lipid abnormalities
found in obese patients with metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes.

Initially, in the earlier studies
such as the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), a 20% cardiovascular (CV)  event rate
was found in statin-treated patients.

However, recent statin studies using high-dose statin therapy to
achieve intensive LDL-C lowering have shown a further reduction in the risk of CHD.

Nevertheless,
there still exists an approximately 9% residual risk despite intensive LDL-C lowering.36 A persis -
tent presence of atherogenic lipoproteins unrecognized by the traditional lipid panel is now felt to
play a role in the residual risk.

This situation has been described as “a treatment gap that can be
recognized and closed with more intensive therapy only if the atherogenic particle is measured.”31
Atherogenic lipoproteins have been shown to increase the risk of ASCVD, and their reduction
by the use of statins has been shown to reduce both the group and individual risk of ASCVD.

If
lifestyle modifications fail to reduce an individual’s atherogenic lipoprotein risk, statin therapy is
appropriate in those patients at the highest risk.

FIGURE 4.4  Presence of residual cardiovascular risk in large prospective studies of optimal statin therapy.51 Lipid Subfraction Testing
Until December 2013, the major assessment of success of an individual’s risk reduction has been
by the results of a specific target LDL-C value obtained by traditional lipid testing.

Using this mea -
surement, “clinical studies indicate that treatment with statins reduces the risk of major CV events
by 21% for every 39 mg/dL decrease in LDL-C and that when LDL-C is lowered below 70 mg/dL,
further reduction in CV risk is accomplished.”36 Overall, the amount of risk reduction by the use of
statin therapy is approximately 30% when given moderately intensive statin therapy and up to a risk
reduction of 45% for more intensive therapy when LDL-C is reduced by up to 50%.37
The focus of the late 2013 ACC/AHA Guidelines was away from the use of statin therapy based
on goals to achieve specific LDL-C and non-HDL-C targets.

Instead, the new recommended focus
was on the use of statin therapy for “all individuals at increased ASCVD risk who are likely to
benefit from risk reduction.” While lifestyle modification is recognized as a cornerstone of therapy
before and during therapy, the new guidelines identified 4 statin benefit groups while at the same
time reinforcing the need for either “moderate-intensity or high-intensity statin therapy” to lower
LDL-C by 30%–50%.38 The 2013 ACC/AHA Guidelines produce evidence from multiple studies
supporting statin therapy as an important tool to achieve documented risk reduction.

I feel that the approach should be more individual-based relying on a working knowledge of the
key studies of risk reduction with and without statin use and a keen awareness and ability to follow
a patient carefully who is prescribed a statin.

There are clearly some clinically identifiable high-risk
patients whose underlying abnormal lipid subfraction values result in further treatment leading to
further risk reduction.

Such treatment requires analysis of the individual’s persistent high-risk lipid
subfractions to guide individualized therapy.

I determine an estimate of an individual’s risk of future atherosclerotic events after obtaining a
lifestyle history, a family history, stress test results, lab data analysis, a physical examination, and
a global risk factor assessment, which may include a lipid subfraction analysis.

If there is a high
future risk or atherosclerosis is already present, I do not hesitate to add in a statin with clear goals
to obtain safe lipid-lowering and inflammation-lowering results.

In such high-risk patients, I want
to know the lipid subfraction data to both guide and judge my therapy.

The goal is the maximal risk
reduction for the individual patient.

Tables 4.1 and 4.2 summarize and compare the current components of the traditional lipid profile
panel and the NMR LipoProfile lipid subfraction panel.

Table 4.3 summarizes the benefits and the
drawback associated with the traditional lipid profile.

Table 4.3 summarizes the benefits and the
drawback associated with the traditional lipid profile.

TABLE 4.1
Traditional Lipid Profile
• Total cholesterol
• LDL cholesterol [TC – (HDL + TG/5)]
• non-HDL cholesterol (TC – HDL)
• HDL cholesterol
• Triglyceride
TABLE 4.2
NMR LipoProfile
• LDL particle concentration: LDL–P
• LDL-small dense LDL subclass
• HDL particle concentration: HDL–P
• HDL large HDL subclass
• Triglyceride subclass: large VLDL–P52 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
The traditional lipid panel testing measures the amount of cholesterol and triglyceride within
various types of lipoproteins providing an LDL-C level.

The NMR lipoprofile measures directly the
amount of lipoprotein molecules providing an LDL particle number (LDL-P).

The NMR method
quantifies the signals broadcast by lipoproteins of different size to accurately measure the concen -
tration of each subclass of lipoproteins.39 Although the traditional lipid panel uses the cholesterol
content as surrogate markers for the levels of the lipoproteins, the NMR LipoProfile measures
directly the amount of atherogenic lipoproteins avoiding the likelihood of a “treatment gap” due to
hidden atherogenic lipoproteins.

Figures 4.5 and 4.640 illustrate how the NMR LipoProfile obtains the specific measurements of
the various lipoproteins.

The particle concentration of different-sized lipoprotein subclasses are
derived from the NMR measured amplitudes of the terminal methyl groups of the specific lipo -
proteins.

The concentrations used are nmol/L for LDL and VLDL particles and µmol/L for HDL
particles compared to concentrations of mg/dL for the traditionally measured lipoproteins.

Lipoprotein subclasses do not have all the same associations with CHD.

In Figure 4.7,39 the break -
down of the various NMR-derived lipoproteins are displayed.

There are 3 subtypes of VLDL with the
large VLDL felt to be of higher risk.

There are 4 subtypes of LDL-all of which make up the LDL-P.

The small, dense LDL lipoproteins are of higher risk in many subgroups of patients but especially
those with insulin resistance and/or metabolic syndrome.

There are three subtypes of HDL and the
large HDL may be more protective than the small HDL in most (but possibly not all) subgroups of

Benefits Drawbacks
• Availability • The presence of a treatment gap:
• Historical data • An underestimation of true risk by LDL-C
• TG elevation can hide the true LDL level
• Small dense LDL – not measured
• Total HDL-P & HDL subclasses – not measured
• Higher risk TG subclass – not measured53 Lipid Subfraction Testing
patients.

It would not be surprising to find that the large HDL subfractions may be beneficial and pre -
dictive of lower risk in some subgroups of patients such as metabolic syndrome and yet not helpful in
other genetically acquired dyslipidemias.

I expect that the use of some lipid subfractions will be found
to be specifically helpful in the assessment and treatment for a specific clinical subtype of patient.

Detecting and diminishing atherogenic subfractions have the potential to reduce the risk of
ASCVD.

Detecting and diminishing atherogenic subfractions have the potential to reduce the risk of
ASCVD.

Nevertheless, controversy exists as to whether (1) any lipid subfractions should be tested
and (2) which patients (based on either clinical/family history issues or preliminary laboratory data)
should have this additional testing performed.5,37,41–43
The most widely agreed on helpful measurement is the LDL-P, which provides a better assess -
ment of ASCVD risk in many high-risk patients than the traditionally measured LDL-C.

The
LDL-P represents the sum total of all the LDL lipoproteins measured by NMR.

This value is very
comparable to an apoB level because it, like an apoB level, represents an accurate level of an indi -
vidual’s atherogenic lipoproteins.

Comparative clinical studies have shown that the levels of the various lipoproteins themselves,
rather than the cholesterol content, in many (but not all) patients, better determine the risks of ath -
erosclerosis.44 The cholesterol content of the lipoproteins as measured by the traditional lipid panel
testing are best viewed as surrogate markers39 for the underlying level of lipoproteins.

The main
issue is that while the traditional lipid panel is accurate for many patients, it often fails to identify
the higher risk that some patients possess.Each diﬀerent-size lipoprotein par ticle broadc asts a
distinguishable NMR signal .

give the concentr ations of the par ticles .

This summary of the possible role and benefits of lipid subfraction testing derives from a 13-year
clinical use of the NMR LipoProfile.45 I use NMR LipoProfile testing as part of a global risk factor
assessment (Figure 4.1) in evaluating those patients who possess an increased risk of ASCVD or
who already have evidence of atherosclerosis.

otHer testing  coMPanies
Berkley Heart Lab, now a part of Quest Laboratory,46 utilizes ion mobility analysis to directly mea -
sure LDL-P and subfractions of LDL, VLDL, and HDL.

In one study,47 LDL subfractions obtained
by this technology found evidence of an increased risk of ASCVD associated with the presence of
small to medium dense LDL particles and a decreased risk of atherosclerosis associated with higher
values of large HDL particles.

Atherotech48 currently offers lipid subfraction testing that includes measurements of LDL-
particle and subclasses, total HDL and subclasses, and remnant lipoproteins.

Boston Heart Diagnostics49 offers lipid subfraction testing along with an extensive array of bio -
logically plausible risk factors.

Boston Heart Diagnostics is the only laboratory that provides the
HDL map, which identifies and quantifies the amount of five different-size subfractions of maturing
HDL molecules.

The measurement of the largest HDL using The HDL map methodology has been
shown to be predictive of cardiovascular risk in both women and men.50–55 Additionally, Boston
Heart Diagnostic provides unique measurements of an individual’s production and absorption of
cholesterol, which allows for more personalized choices of statins versus ezetimibe or the use of
both together.

The methodology of small dense LDL testing by Boston Heart Diagnostic differs
from the small dense LDL NMR Liposcience testing and the clinical usefulness of one method
versus the other has yet to be directly studied.

THE NMR LIPOPROFILE: THE DETAILS
ldl l iPoProtein  Particle  nuMber
Traditional lipid panel lipid testing fails to always identify the presence of high-risk atherogenic
lipoproteins.

Although the calculation of non-HDL cholesterol does provide additional informa -
tion about “hidden” triglyceride-rich” atherogenic lipoproteins, it reflects the cholesterol content
of atherogenic particles, but not the accurate number of atherogenic particles as does the NMR
LipoProfile and apoB levels.56
The NMR LipoProfile provides 5 potentially important lipid subfractions that can help assess
risk and guide therapy in the individual patient.

The most commonly accepted helpful marker is the
LDL particle number (LDL-P) (Table 4.4).

Because the LDL-C relies on the cholesterol content of lipoproteins and the NMR LipoProfile
measures the number of particles by themselves, there can exist “discordance” between the results
when tested simultaneously.

Discordance is defined as a situation when the traditionally measured
LDL-C level and the LDL particle number (LDL-P) differ significantly from each while testing the
TABLE 4.4

• LDL-small dense LDL subclass
• HDL particle concentration: HDL-P
• HDL large HDL subclass
• Triglyceride subclass: large VLDL-P55 Lipid Subfraction Testing
same specimen at the same time.

This can result in one LDL measurement being reported as nor -
mal while the other LDL measurement would be reported as abnormal.

Hence a discordance exists.

When discordance exists between these two tests of LDL concentration, the LDL-C is often
found to either underestimate or overestimate the true level of underlying atherogenic lipoproteins
compared to the LDL-P measurement.

The more common directional type of discordance occurs with an underestimation of the risk.

When this occurs, the more accurate predictive risk lies with the LDL-P measurement rather than
the LDL-C measurement.

In this scenario, if the LDL-C was found to be normal and the LDL-P
was found to still be elevated, more treatment might be added because of the higher risk predicted
by an elevated LDL-P.
Conversely, there can be discordance in the opposite direction.

In this instance, the LDL-C
reports out a measurement that is normal while the simultaneous LDL-P reports out a low mea -
surement.

Similar to the other directional discordance, the LDL-P measurement has been found
to be the more correct value as it relates to a reduced predictive risk compared to a higher, LDL-C
measurement.

An example of this dual type of directional discordance between LDL-P and LDL-C is seen
in the analysis Figure 4.8.

In this study, 516 patients on the high end of risk are more accu -
rately defined by LDL-P; and 553 patients on the low end of risk are more accurately defined by
LDL -P.44
In Figure 4.9 from the Framingham Offspring Study,57 the risk of future CV events over
15 years was higher in 282 patients who were found to simultaneously have high LDL-P values and
yet lower LDL-C values.

This again demonstrates the discordance that can exist between LDL-P
and LDL-C.

In both these studies, a significant number of patients were determined to have a
residual ASCVD risk uncovered by LDL-P testing.

A recent analysis of data from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database from 16 Wellpoint/
Anthem plans of commercially insured patients supported the importance of measuring LDL-P
over LDL-C. Those high-risk adult patients who ended up receiving more intensive treatment based
on attempts to successfully achieve an LDL-P goal of <1000 μg/dL compared to patients who suc -
cessfully achieved an LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL had a clear reduction in cardiovascular event
rates over the subsequent 12–36 months.58
Two 2013 summary reviews59,60 of the benefits of LDL-P testing over LDL-C testing reinforced
this issue of hidden discordance.

The final assessment was that the use of LDL-P for monitoring
lipid-lowering therapy, especially for those patients on statins, can provide a more accurate assess -

In summary, benefits that result from the use of Lipid Subfraction Testing to assess LDL-P are
1.

To better assess the presence of a residual risk due to an underestimated presence of resid -
ual atherogenic lipoproteins, i.e., the identification of a “Treatment Gap”
2.

SUMMARY QUESTIONS: LDL PARTICLE NUMBER
1.

Is LDL particle number linked to CHD risk?

Yes.

2.

Is LDL particle number superior to LDL-C calculation?

Yes, often because typically there
is a 25%–33% discordance rate with the predictive results tracking with the LDL-P over
the LDL-C.
3.

Has the LDL particle number been shown to be superior to non-HDL cholesterol measure -
ment?

Non-HDL cholesterol is a better predictor of ASCVD risk because it measures the
atherogenic particle number better than LDL-C.60 However, both LDL-P and apoB levels
more accurately measure the total atherogenic particle number thereby more successfully
capturing any associated residual risk.

In addition, there also exists a potential discordance
between non-HDL cholesterol and LDL-P.61
4.

Is LDL particle number widely available and reimbursed?

Practically it has to be drawn in
the office although individual laboratories may take blood specimens.

Medicare covers the
test; $99 if uncovered by insurance.

Increasingly the NMR derived LDL-P is also becom -
ing available as one element of testing within specialized lipid panels (Figure 4.10).00.740.760.780.800.820.840.860.880.90

5.

Has the LDL particle number been shown to better predict the presence of treatable resid -
ual risk reduction when the non-HDL is calculated?

It remains to be studied fully but there
is published evidence of clear discordance between the risk defined by non-HDL measure -
ments and LDL-P.61,62
6.

Current National Lipid Association recommendations5 for LDL particle number testing: rea -
sonable for many patients who have intermediate risk score, family history, recurrent events;
it is fine to consider for selected patients with CHD or CHD equivalent.5 I strongly agree,
especially with patients who have metabolic syndrome, elevated triglycerides, or who develop
cardiovascular events despite being on “successful” therapy based on traditional lipid testing.

THE SMALL DENSE LDL PARTICLES
The LDL particles measured by the NMR LipoProfile can be separated into small dense or larger
sizes.

A number of clinical studies have shown higher CHD risk associated with increased levels of
small dense LDL.63–66 In the 1997 Quebec Cardiovascular Study67 (Figure 4.11), men were stratified
by apoB level and LDL particle size.

High apoB was associated with CHD.

The presence of both
high apoB and small dense LDL was associated with a marked increase in CHD risk.

High apoB was associated with CHD.

The presence of both
high apoB and small dense LDL was associated with a marked increase in CHD risk.

Treatment
options would include (1) lowering apoB levels and LDL levels with a statin, and (2) attempting to
change any significant number of residual small dense LDL particles to a larger size via the use of
Niacin, omega-3 fat, fibrates, or a statin itself.

A 13-year follow-up data analysis of the Quebec Cardiovascular Study was published in 2005.68
It reaffirmed the importance of small dense LDL particles in risk of CHD especially in the first
7 years of follow-up.

The analysis also revealed that the larger LDL particles were not associated
with an increase in CHD over the 13-year follow-up.

However, there are other studies that have sug -
gested that larger LDL particles may be associated with a higher risk.69–71
The MESA study published in 200772 utilized NMR LipoProfile testing in analyzing LDL par -
ticle subclasses, LDL size, and the incidence of carotid atherosclerosis.

The MESA study found that
small and large LDL particles were both significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis
and felt strongly there was no higher risk with small dense LDL.

However, in a recent January 2014
study73 of the same MESA group of patients, a new automated homogeneous assay74 of small dense
LDL identified a higher risk of CHD in patients with small dense LDL but only in normoglycemic
individuals while simultaneous NMR-derived small dense LDL data did not discover a higher risk.

There are now at least 5 available techniques that are able to determine LDL particle size and
thus are able to give some measurement of the level of small dense LDL particles.

These include (1)
segmented gradient gel electrophoresis (SGGe), (2) ultracentrifugation vertical auto profile (VAP),
(3) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), (4) ion mobility ( IM),75 and (5) a simple heparin-magnesium
precipitation method (direct homogenous LDL assay).74,76,77Average LDL part icle siz e

While one study75 compared the first four methods of LDL particle size and found substantial
agreement between them, the more recently published and utilized simple precipitation method of
the small dense LDL74,76,77 may be more sensitive and/or more specific.

This possibility is based on
a comparison of the data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) lipoprotein sub -
fraction analysis published in 2007 utilizing the NMR small dense testing method versus testing the
same blood samples from the MESA lipoprotein subfraction analysis published in 2014 utilizing the
simple precipitation, direct homogeneous assay method.

There are subgroups of patients both with and without obvious clinical insulin resistance who
have atherosclerosis and possess measurable levels of small dense LDL that identify increased
ASCVD risk.

It is important to consider lowering the levels of all LDL particles into an optimal
range but especially in those patients who have a significant proportion of their LDL particles made
up of the small dense pattern.

Additionally I have found similar discordant results in some patients whom I have simultane -
ously tested for the level of small dense LDL by NMR and the simple precipitation-homogeneous
assay.

My preliminary results have found a number of patients who had low levels of small dense
LDL-P by NMR and yet elevated levels by the simple precipitation-homogeneous assay.

My preliminary results have found a number of patients who had low levels of small dense
LDL-P by NMR and yet elevated levels by the simple precipitation-homogeneous assay.

The
accuracy of this observation and the percentage of patients who exhibit this discordance between
the various small dense LDL testing modalities and the clinical relevance is unclear at this time.

It requires further study in order to both confirm and to understand the clinical relevance.

The simple precipitation method of small dense LDL testing has had a number of publica -
tions77–86 that attest to its ability to predict atherosclerotic risk.

I believe that the presence of elevated levels of predominantly small dense LDL particles repre -
sent, in some patients, a much higher risk than if the LDL particles were mostly large.

An accurate
and risk predictive measurement of small dense LDL particles is an important tool in guiding the
development of treatment strategies.

Such strategies should be designed to reduce the risk of cardio -
vascular events in both groups of patients and in individual patients who are found to be at risk of
or who already possess atherosclerosis.

In addition, it should be recognized that patients who cannot tolerate statins are often left with
persistent elevated total level of LDL particles.

Non-statin therapy such as Niaspan, omega-3 fat, or
possibly fibrates, should be used to shift the size of the small dense higher risk LDL to a lower risk
larger size LDL.

I believe that patients who cannot tolerate statins should not be left with high levels
of small dense LDL lipoproteins if a shift can be accomplished toward the larger size.

In my experience, it is not uncommon to find elderly women with no evidence of atherosclero -
sis but with elevated levels of total cholesterol and LDL-P particles of which almost all are in the
large size.

These women also typically possess elevated levels of HDL-P and large HDL levels,
and are thin without any abdominal fat.

In this subgroup, the presence of elevated large LDL
particles do not appear to be associated with an increased risk of ASCVD and I typically do not
treat them with a statin if there are no other risk factors placing the patient at increased risk.Odds ratio f or IHD

FIGURE 4.11  Quebec Cardiovascular Study: LDL particles and ischemic heart disease risk.59 Lipid Subfraction Testing
Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia87,88 have both increased large LDL particle num -
bers along with very high total LDL-C levels and this group of patients possess a clear risk of early
onset of heart disease.

However, when familial hypercholesterolemia patients were given Simvastatin
alone versus Simvastatin and Ezetimibe (Zetia) for 2 years in the AIM-HIGH Study,89 the group
given Simvastatin and Ezetimibe reached significantly lower total LDL-C levels and yet surprisingly
did not do as well as the group given Simvastatin alone.

This finding may be explained, in part, by
possibility of an unrecognized shift of LDL particles from the possibly lower risk large LDL subfrac -
tion toward the higher risk small dense LDL subfraction that appears to occur in an as yet undeter -
mined percentage of patients when Ezetimibe (Zetia) is added to a patient already taking a statin.

Lipid subfraction data were not performed in this study.

This hidden shift may occur in 30%–40%
of patients but it needs to be studied using the most sensitive and specific assay of small dense LDL.

Ezetimibe (Zetia)90 has been shown to shift the proportion of large LDL-C particles toward the
small dense particles, which might explain the lack of carotid artery benefit from the additional cho -
lesterol lowering in the group receiving both Ezetimibe and a statin (Richard M. Delany, Unpublished
observations, 2008).

If this potentially harmful essentially hidden-from-view “ezetimibe LDL shift”
is shown to occur in a significant percentage of patients when combined with a statin, it would give
more credence to the potential higher risk of small LDL particles over large LDL particles.

Further studies, utilizing the most sensitive and specific small dense LDL particle assay, should
be performed in statin naïve patients, defining both their unique baseline cholesterol absorption and
production status along with their lipid subfractions.

Repeat studies should then be performed on a
statin alone, on ezetimibe alone, and when ezetimibe is added to patient already on a statin.

I believe
it is important to confirm or exclude whether or not an essentially hidden “ezetimibe shift” might be
occurring in a significant percentage of patients or in specific subtype of patient.

Patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia have predominantly small dense LDL lipopro -
teins and these particles appear to be directly related to cardiovascular events, independent of meta -
bolic syndrome, total cholesterol, and apoB.91
The risk of small dense LDL particles may primarily be related to the fact that patients with
small dense LDL have more particles than those with same level of cholesterol that are large LDL
(Figure  4.12)40 In some patients, a greater ASCVD risk reduction can be achieved by lowering
elevated levels of small dense LDL particles.

This is especially important in patients with metabolic
syndrome.

It should be noted that overweight individuals who are able to achieve a weight reduction of
20–30 pounds accompanied by a loss of their truncal obesity often normalize their NMR LipoProfile
without the need for a statin (to be discussed in a following first case study).

In this type of clinical
scenario of resolution of metabolic syndrome with diet alone, the total LDL-P becomes markedly
decreased along with a significant lowering of small dense LDL-P and an actual rise in the large
LDL-P and a moderate increase in the large HDL.

I believe this type of abnormal NMR LipoProfile
reversal with or without lipid-lowering drugs is associated with a decreased risk of CHD.

In summary, it appears that the size of the LDL and the associated risk can be different for dif -
ferent subgroups of patients.

Patients with familial hypercholesteremia do appear to have elevated
levels of large LDL that promote atherosclerosis.

However, for most other groups, I believe that
elevated small dense LDL particles, do in fact, point to a higher risk.

The fact that small dense LDL-P is not as a high a risk for one group of patients as it is for another
does not mean that it should not be viewed as a potential modifiable risk factor in many patients at
risk of or already with atherosclerosis.

Individualizing patient assessment and treatment is a com -
mon everyday event in the offices of health-care practitioners.

The use of lipid subfraction testing as
it relates to the assessment of individual patients at risk is especially helpful in patients with clinical
features of metabolic syndrome or who possess lipid patterns revealing high triglycerides and low
HDL and a discordance between LDL-C and LDL-P.

In many patients, the discovery of elevated
small dense LDL levels identify higher risk and often provide an opportunity to further reduce an
individual’s risk.

SUMMARY QUESTIONS: LDL SUBFRACTIONS:
SMALL DENSE VERSUS LARGE BUOYANT
1.

Is small dense LDL a strong risk marker of CHD risk?

Probably yes, especially in patients with insulin resistance and/or metabolic syndrome.

72,"Chunk 72:
Is small dense LDL a strong risk marker of CHD risk?

Probably yes, especially in patients with insulin resistance and/or metabolic syndrome.

However, in the 2007 MESA study, the risk linked more to the LDL-P concentration rather
than to either large and small LDL subclasses.

Yet, a recent retesting of MESA study
serum using a new automated small dense LDL technique found higher risk in normogly -
cemic men with elevated small dense LDL particles.

A persistently elevated small dense LDL-P should be carefully assessed and treatment
should be considered to lower it and/or to promote its shift into a larger LDL-P subtype.

Both statin and non-statin therapies can be used, especially if the patient cannot success -
fully lower his LDL-P < 1000 nmol/L.

2.

What reduces the small dense LDL while increasing the large buoyant LDL?

Weight loss in patients with metabolic syndrome, control of diabetes, lowering of tri -
glycerides, niacin, omega-3, fibrates, and possible withdrawal of ezetimibe (via cessation
of a possible ezetimibe shift of large LDL toward small dense LDL).

3.

What can move the large LDL toward a small dense LDL?

Weight gain, especially truncal obesity; addition of ezetimide to a patient already on
a statin; excess carbohydrate intake; poorly controlled diabetes; and increased trans fat/
saturated fat intake.

A patient with risk factors for atherosclerosis who also is found to have an elevated
small dense LDL particle number increases the importance of instituting a global risk fac -
tor approach to the individual patient.

Typically, this leads to monitoring the lipid values
more carefully, aggressively attempting to eradicate insulin resistance by exercise, diet,
and the use of non-statin lipoprotein-modifying therapy, i.e., the addition of omega-3 fat,
niacin or fibrates, and consideration of the use of statins.

Rosuvastatin (Crestor), a potent
statin medication, may have more favorable modification of existing small dense LDL-P,92
but more experience and data collection has to occur.

4.

Are there any prospective studies showing a treatment strategy specifically designed to
change LDL subfractions is superior than to just treating the LDL-P or LDL-C?

No, not that I am aware of.

5.

Have any clinical subgroups shown benefit by reducing small dense LDL and increasing
large LDL?

Yes, but it often occurs by lowering total LDL-P and correcting other modifiable risk
factors making it difficult to know the specific benefit attained specifically by the lowering
small dense LDL particles and the raising of the large LDL particle numbers.61 Lipid Subfraction Testing
I approach the issue of the possibility of less of a risk of increased large LDL particles
versus increased small dense LDL particles by separating patients into clinical and lipid
subfraction subgroups: (1) Patients with predominantly all large LDL: If they have familial
hypercholesterolemiia, I recommend aggressive treatment.

(2) A second group are very
healthy with no other worrisome lipid subfractions and no clinical risk factors.

With these
group of patients, I don’t routinely start them on a statin and I focus primarily on non-
pharmacologic therapy.

I used the LDL-P measurement as a guideline seeking ideally to
have it < 1000 nmol/L and I use a water soluble statin when I do give them a statin.

(3) A
third, more common subgroup are those who have elevated large LDL-P and large LDL,
having typically shifted or in the process of shifting from small dense to large LDL parti -
cles.

These patients have usually typically been placed on a therapy or life style change that
has caused a beneficial shift away from small dense to the large buoyant LDL particles.

It’s
more important to keep the LDL in the large subgroup than in the small but I would also
try to lower their LDL-P to below 1000 nmol/L.

I would not want to lower the Large LDL
at the expense of raising the amount of small dense LDL particles.

I would not want to lower the Large LDL
at the expense of raising the amount of small dense LDL particles.

This can occur with the
addition of ezteimibe to an unknown percentage of patients already on a statin.

6.

Are there any current (11/2013) National Lipid Association recommendations93 for LDL
particle subclasses?

“Don’t test for them” was the recommendation in November 2013.

I currently believe
in testing for small dense LDL in patients who have evidence of residual risk (patients
who have gone on to develop more atherosclerosis while on therapy) and patients in those
clinical subgroups who are likely to have elevated levels of small dense LDL—those with
metabolic syndrome, elevated triglycerides or diabetes.

LARGE VLDL PARTICLE NUMBER
The large VLDL particle level (VLDL-P) is another reported NMR-derived lipoprotein
(Figure  4.13).

This is best viewed as a potentially high risk triglyceride subgroup.

The large
VLDL or triglyceride may represent a higher risk than other smaller VLDL lipoproteins.94 The
response of this lipid subfraction to the implementation of broad-based treatment plans encom -
passing lifestyle issues such as diet, weight loss, better control of diabetes, and regular weekly
exercise along with omega-3 fat intake and niacin, can be very rewarding for the patient and
physician alike.

The triglyceride value is often regarded as not a “statistically significant risk factor” when ana -
lyzed via group analysis.

However, I feel the triglyceride is another example of matching the rel -
evance of the lipoprotein abnormality to the individual.

This individual-focused concept has been
best stated by Dr. Allan Sniderman:
The actual hazard that a factor poses to an individual depends on the actual level of that factor within
the individual not on the average hazard of the factor for the group.…Clinical decisions should be based
on the risk in the individual not on risk in the group.95
Individuals with elevated triglyceride (VLDL) values often have associated truncal obesity,
insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance.

Triglyceride elevation may not be a formally recognized

risk factor, but it is clearly associated with these other atherogenic clinical elements that promote
atherosclerosis.

Effective treatment of elevated triglycerides have effects on small dense LDL, HDL,
and blood sugar control—all of which translate into reduced risk for the individual.

SUMMARY KEY QUESTIONS: LARGE VLDL
1.

Has large VLDL particle number been linked to CHD risk?

Variable and difficult to evaluate in isolation.

However, in the HATS trial, where
patients received simvastatin and niacin, decreased coronary artery stenosis was seen in
patients whose large VLDL became lower along with lowering of small dense LDL and an
increase in large HDL.94
2.

Is the large VLDL particle number associated with more CV risk?

Possibly because it remodels to become small dense LDL particles, and when
large triglyceride-rich VLDL particles are not remodeled to LDL, they become more
pro-atherogenic.96
3.

What reduces the large VLDL level?

Fish oil, low carbohydrate diet, loss of abdominal obesity, improvement in the con -
trol of diabetes, Niaspan, fibrates, and some statins (Atorvastatin) may be better than
others.

4.

Are there clinical subgroups who have no increased risk from the presence of increased
large VLDL?

Unknown; it is difficult to study in isolation from LDL-P and HDL.

5.

National Lipid Association recommendations for VLDL testing?

Do not test for it!

Because it is a routine part of the NMR LipoProfile, we can realize its
limitations and we can individually assess its potential relevance in the individual patient.

Do not test for it!

Because it is a routine part of the NMR LipoProfile, we can realize its
limitations and we can individually assess its potential relevance in the individual patient.

Seeing it improve with a life style change is a nice conversation to have with a patient.

HDL CHOLESTEROL: THE “GOOD” CHOLESTEROL
HDL has multiple beneficial functions, but the most well-recognized function is the reverse trans -
port function whereby cholesterol from cells in the peripheral sites in the body (including from
atherosclerotic plaques) are delivered to the liver for breakdown (Figure 4.14).

Other functions are
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, anti-infective, and the capacity to modulate insulin
secretion.

Thus, HDL is not just a single molecule but possesses a high level of complexity linked to
its protein and lipid components, which vary from one group of HDL molecules to another.97
Viewing the HDL subfractions as the large HDL as being good and the small HDL as being bad
is probably an oversimplification.

We have to wait for greater understanding of the functional
aspects of different HDL molecules and how to test for them and promote their antiatherogenic
functionality.

The NMR LipoProfile provides the total HDL particle number (HDL-P) that measures accurately
the total number of HDL particles.

The traditional HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) measures the cho -
lesterol content as opposed to the particle number themselves similar to the limitations of LDL-C
versus LDL-P.
From an epidemiologic standpoint, low serum levels of HDL-C have been found to be one of
the best predictors of CHD risk.

It is still accepted and agreed upon that individuals who naturally
possess higher levels of HDL-C are statistically (as a group) at a lower risk of CHD, and those who
naturally possess lower values are at a higher risk of CHD.

Also raising HDL levels in animals have
been shown to reduce future atherosclerosis.

However, problems have occurred when it has been tried to extend those facts to the belief in the
“HDL Hypothesis.” This is defined as a belief that “actively raising HDL levels in humans would
reduce clinical CHD events.”
The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS)98 and the HDL Atherosclerosis Treatment
Study (HATS)99 studies revealed that powerful LDL-C lowering by a statin and HDL-C raising
with Niacin could substantially reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

However, these two
studies did not address whether Niacin and/or HDL-raising added any benefit to the LDL-lowering
effect of a statin.

Four additional studies (ARBITER 2, ARBITER 3, ARBITER 6, and the Oxford
Niaspan Study) also showed positive results when Niaspan was added to a statin, but they still did
not answer the question if Niacin and/or HDL raising by themselves contributed to the positive
results.

Four subsequent studies (The AIM-HIGH,89,100 HPS2-THRIVE,101 ILLUMINATE,102 and
dal-OUTCOMES103) placed the HDL cholesterol hypothesis at risk because of no benefit or the
actual risk of harm.

However, these four studies had a number of flaws that suggests that the HDL
Hypothesis should not yet be discarded.

One of the flaws possibly was the use of Ezetimibe (Zetia)
in the AIM-HIGH trial because of its hidden effect of possibly increasing small dense LDL par -
ticles at the expense of large LDL being lowered.90 Nevertheless, these events have led to a current
consensus that HDL-C-targeted therapies, in general, and Niacin, specifically, may not be helpful.

In the Jupiter Trial, HDL-P was found to be a better marker of residual risk than chemically mea -
sured HDL-C or apoA-1.104 Additionally, two studies that included testing of HDL-P and HDL size
have supported the fact that HDL size and HDL-P are individually associated with decreased risk
of CAD105 and that increasing HDL-P with a fibrate alone produced clinical benefit out of propor -
tion to the modest increase in HDL-C, and that this may have occurred because HDL-P increased
more.106,107 This data, while limited in scope, mirrors somewhat the LDL-C versus LDL-P data
in that HDL-C is a poor test to follow as you treat a patient to raise the HDL but possibly HDL-P
has some predictive benefit.

Future studies will probably clarify these issues more completely (see
Figure 4.15).

At this time, there is an active search for tests of HDL function that could lead to effective treat -
ment linked to reduction of ASCVD risk.

Meanwhile, testing of the HDL-P and the large HDL level
are best viewed with more questions than answers as to their role in the individual patient.

Practically speaking, an NMR LipoProfile provides the HDL information along with the
beneficial  data of an individual’s LDL-P and small dense LDL.

Reviewing the HDL data of an
individual while realizing its limitations seems potentially helpful if such an analysis might answer
the question: Does HDL-P and /or the large HDL concentration increase as healthy lifestyle and global
risk modifications are successfully implemented?

I have commonly seen the large HDL increase and
the small HDL decrease as patients’ lifestyle improves.

Reviewing HDL data while realizing its limita -
tions seems reasonable especially if such an analysis might answer the question: does HDL-P and large
HDL increase as healthy lifestyles and global risk factor modifications are implemented?

I typically see
the large HDL and the small HDL decrease as patient’s lifestyle changes improve their overall health.

Boston Heart Diagnostics has developed a unique HDL Map that has very supportive published
data 57-63 confirming its ability to predict risk
SUMMARY QUESTIONS: TOTAL HDL PARTICLE NUMBER
AND HDL LARGE OR SMALL
1.

Is HDL-P linked to CHD risk?

Unknown but probably lower values ( possibly  < 34 mg/dl) supports the possibility of
higher risk and raising the HDL-P with a fibrate may reduce risk (i.e., VA-HIT Study).

HDL-P was a better marker of residual risk in the Jupiter Trial, and an editorial discussing
HDL-P’s strong inverse relationship with cardiovascular events suggested it might be time
to “move from a cholesterol-based to a particle-based world.”108
2.

Is the small HDL less protective than large HDL?

Unknown but possibly.

Based on some studies, the small HDL appears to be associated
with increased risk in some clinical subgroups, whereas the larger HDL appears to reduce risk.

But we really just do not yet know for sure.

HDL functional assessment may well be the future.

3.

What treatment options tend to promote a shift from the small HDL toward the large HDL?

Niacin, triglyceride reduction, possibly consumption of predominant docosahexae -
noic acid (DHA)  (from fish oil), correction of metabolic syndrome with loss of abdominal
obesity.

4.

Have any clinical subgroups shown benefit from having elevated small HDL levels?

Unknown.

There are a few scattered reports of small HDL being beneficial but we do
not know if any size is truly helpful.

As noted, most studies suggest that large HDL might
be more protective.

Clearly, when patients lose weight, exercise, and eat well, the large
HDL goes up and the small HDL goes down.

As noted, most studies suggest that large HDL might
be more protective.

Clearly, when patients lose weight, exercise, and eat well, the large
HDL goes up and the small HDL goes down.

Current National Lipid Association recommendations HDL subfractions?

No proven benefit, do not test for it.

The value of the HDL-P particle concentration is unknown but it may be helpful in
predicting risk in some subjects.

Additionally I often seen the large HDL go up in patients
who have lost weight, have changed their eating habits and exercise regularly.

LIPOPROTEIN(A)
Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) consists of an LDL particle containing “little” protein that is attached to the
apoB component of LDL.

The apoA is a liver-derived protein that belongs to the plasminogen fam -
ily suggesting a possible role with thrombosis but it actually has, as yet, no known function.

Even though it is like LDL and VLDL, because it has apoB and an LDL-like lipoprotein features,
Lp(a) has a different metabolism and is not reduced by a statin.

Lp(a) is typically associated with a strong family history of vascular disease because it possesses
a strong hereditary component.109 An elevated value is associated with CHD,110,111 stroke, venous
thromboembolism,112 and an increased incidence of restenosis after angioplasty.65 Lipid Subfraction Testing
The cardiovascular risk starts at an Lp(a) > 25 mg/dL.

Lp(a) values greater than 25–39 mg/dL
are present in 30% of Caucasians and 60%–70% of blacks.

Who should be treated?113–115 A value of Lp(a) > 50 mg/dl is associated with a 20% s risk.

Patients
who have elevated values of Lp(a) in the 30-50 mg/dl range ma have a higher risk if they possess
other risk factors (i.e., elevated small dense LDL elevated LDL-P, low HDL)
The discovery of a patient’s elevated Lp(a) value represents an opportunity to reduce an indi -
vidual’s cardiovascular risk.

The independent residual risk of Lp(a) is substantial.116
Treatment primarily with Niacin (1–3 g daily) and estrogens lower Lp(a) values and reduce major
coronary events by 25%, stroke by 26%, and any cardiovascular event by 27%.117
ezetiMibe (zetia) story: a H idden  risK uncovered  by liPid subFraction  testing
The discovery of unknown harm that may be occurring can be another advantage of testing lipid
subfractions.

Ezetimibe (brand name: Zetia) is a drug that is used as a LDL-C-lowering agent that
accomplishes the LDL-lowering effect by blocking the absorption of cholesterol.

It is almost always
used in conjunction with a statin drug and together they lower the measured LDL-C more com -
pletely than either agent used alone.

In 2008, a study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine118 titled the ENHANCE
Trial, that tested the use of a statin drug (Simvastatin: brand name Zocor) alone or with use of
Ezetimibe.

The goal was to lower cholesterol in two groups of patients with a genetic disorder
(familial hypercholesterolemia) causing high LDL-C values with the study lasting for 2 years.

One
group received simvastatin alone and the other group received both drugs.

A measure of the rate of
expected progressive increased thickness of the lining of the carotid arteries over the 2 years served
as the differentiating test.

The expectation was that the expected lowering of the LDL in the group
of patients who took both drugs would achieve a much lower cholesterol (which occurred) and a
lower rate of progressive thickening (which surprisingly did not occur).

After the 2008 publication of the ENHANCE Trial, I chose a few of my patients who were on
Ezetimibe and a statin, obtained baseline lipid subfraction levels and stopped the Ezetimibe and
repeated the lipid subfraction values 4–6 weeks later.

I found that while the total LDL-C went up
off Ezetimibe, high levels of small dense LDL that had been present while on the dual therapy
of a statin and ezetimibe, went markedly down.

in some, but not all, of the patients.

in some, but not all, of the patients.

The number
of patients were too small to accurately gauge the percentage of patients who exhibit an appar -
ent shift of LDL particles from large to small when ezetimibe (Zetia) is added to a statin and the
reverse occurring when it is stopped.

This tendency of ezetimibe to enhance the production of
small dense LDL at the expense of large LDL has been noted and published by Berneis et al.

in
2010.89
It appears that Ezetimibe, when combined with a statin, appears to promote the conversion of
large LDL lipoproteins into small dense lipoproteins.

It is unclear what percentage of patients exhibit
this change from large to small dense lipoprotein.

These small dense LDL particles are essentially
hidden from view unless they are specifically tested for through the use of lipid subfraction test -
ing.

As noted, small dense LDL lipoproteins have been shown in a number of studies to be more
proatherogenic than the larger LDL cholesterol, but opinions still differ.

Also it is now appreciated
that the various Lipid subfraction small dense LDL testing techniques may differ in their ability to
accurate measure the level of small dense LDL.

The latest measurement74 may be the most sensitive
and specific small dense LDL assay.

I discovered the “ezetimibe shift” using nuclear magnetic resonance in 2008.

Berneis90 used
gradient gel electrophoresis and found the same shift toward the small dense LDL, offsetting the
favorable effect of a statin alone in reducing the level of small dense LDL.

Because of the Simple Precipitation-Homogeneous Assay’s74 ability to possibly discover the
presence of small dense more accurately than the other available measures, I believe this assay
should be used along with NMR to clarify the presence of an ezetimibe shift when added to a statin 66 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
and, if present, the percentage of patients who experience this potentially harmful shift.

If this shift
is confirmed to be present, understanding to whom it occurs and why would be important.

I sent a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine  weeks after the study was
published summarizing these findings, but the letter was not published.

Since then, a study has
been published in the European Heart Journal90 in 2010 supporting the same findings.

This 2010
study also found that small dense LDL particles appear to frequently increase when ezetimibe is
combined with a statin.

It should be noted that one of the studies89 (AIM-HIGH TRIAL) with Niacin that showed no
benefit in reducing risk when raising HDL also had patients taking Ezetimibe to try to keep the
LDL-C levels at the same level during the trial.

Lipid subfractions were not obtained.

A hidden-
from-view shift from large LDL to the small dense LDL may have occurred during the AIM-HIGH-
Trial possibly explaining the negative effects of Niacin on HDL raising and CHD risk reduction.

(See Tables 4.5 and 4.6 Figures 4.16 and 4.17.)

In November 2014, the results of the IMPROVE IT Trial of ezetemibe( Zetia) plus simvastatin
(Zocor) 40 mg was presented at the American Heart Association 2014 Scientific Sessions.119 The
study lasted 7 years and included more than 18,000 patients from 39 countries who were stable
(< 10 days) after a recent acute coronary syndrome.

Patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms: simvastatin (Zocor) 40 mg alone and
simvastatin (Zocor) 40 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg (Zetia).

2.5 years or until 5250 events occurred in the study participants.

The LDL-C with simvastatin alone
at 1 year was 69.9 mg/dl; the LDL-C with simvastatin and ezetimibe at 1 year was 53.2 mg/dl.

The end points of cardiovascular death, heart attack, unstable angina requiring hospitalization,
coronary artery bypass grating, or stroke was reduced 6.4% in patients on the combination of simv -
astatin and ezetimibe versus simvastatin alone.

The absolute reduction over 7 years was 2.0% with
32.7% of patients in the simvastain /Zetia arm experiencing a primary end point versus 34.7 % in the
simvastatin alone arm experiencing an event.

The major event reduction occurred in the occurrence
of a heart attack or stroke but the all-cause mortality was not affected by the treatment.

This is one of the first trials where Zetia combined with a statin showed improvement over a
statin alone.

While the results were modest, the risk of cardiovascular events were clearly slightly
less within the ezetimibe/simvastatin arm.

There was no lipid subfraction data obtained before or
during this study.

How does this study affect my concern about combining ezetimibe with a statin to achieve a
reduced risk of cardiovascular events?

I believe we still need to find the answers to some questions:
• Is there a tendency of Zetia to shift the absolute number of small dense LDL particles to a
higher level ( typically unseen by traditional lipid testing level)?

• If present, how frequently does it occur and does it persist over the long term?

• Is small dense LDL not as atherogenic when the LDL-C is brought to levels < 70 mg/dl?

(and LDL-P levels below 800 nmol/L?)

• Does the knowledge of a patient’s level of cholesterol absorption and production at baseline
and over time affect the occurrence and duration of an ezetimibe shift?

• Is there a subgroup patients who should not take ezetimibe because of this shift and if so,
how can we identify them clinically or by laboratory testing?

• Does an ezetimibe shift only occur with some statins and not with others, and if so, why?

• Does starting the statin and ezetimibe at the same time have a different effect than when
Zetia is added to a statin to the same patient?

While we wait for the literature to answer these questions, I still recommend remaining  cautious
about adding ezetimibe to a statin without obtaining baseline level of LDL-P and small dense LDL.

Ideally obtaining baseline levels of LDL-P and small dense LDL before Zetia is added to a statin
and then rechecking the same testing 4-6 weeks later would no longer allow any shifts to be hidden
from the view of the prescribing physician.

If a patient is already on a statin/ezetimibe combination, stopping ezetimibe alone for
4–6 weeks and repeating the testing would also provide the information about the presence of a
hidden small dense LDL shift in the individual patient.

WHY LIPID SUBFRACTION TESTING?

Lipid subfraction testing is performed to obtain additional information about a patient’s often hid -
den-from-view potential atherogenic lipoproteins.

Lipid subfraction testing provides some answers
to important questions: (1) Does the patient possess high risk lipoprotein levels that place him/her
at risk?

(2) Does the patient, therefore, need additional therapy to reduce any potential residual
risk that still exists?

(3) Has the patient’s total treatment strategy (drugs, diet, lifestyle, exercise, Lipoprotein eﬀec ts of lipid modifying the rapy

nutritional supplements) been successful in correcting parameters that have been shown to be linked
to increased risk?

(4) Has a specific treatment helped, hurt and has been neutral with regard to the
lipoprotein abnormality of interest?

I believe that by obtaining a lipid subfraction test (NMR from
Liposcience or from other lipid subfraction testing laboratories), a hidden persistent risk of ASCVD
can be uncovered in a significant number of patients.

Once identified, a treatment plan can then be
implemented in an attempt to correct the specific imbalances.

The treatment plan does not have to be a drug but could very well be a lifestyle change or a
change in diet.

However, if the test result and clinical assessment identifies the patient to be in a
high-risk subgroup that has shown (by well-documented meta-analysis)120 to significantly benefit
from the LDL lowering and hsCRP anti-inflammatory effects of statins, then a statin should be seri -
ously considered.

As Sniderman et al.

commented in his discussion about choosing to use a statin
in primary prevention: “Not acting, not using statins in primary prevention is as real an act as using
them.”121
The key point is that when any test is found to discover the presence of hidden atherosclerotic
risk, a treatment plan should be implemented that realistically, safely, and with the full understand -
ing of the patient proceeds to achieve specific goals.

Any or all treatment plans can always be
reviewed and changed as needed based on clinical results, side effects, new medical conditions, or
new knowledge.

The results of a lipid subfraction test often leads to a goal to achieve a greater reduction in the
LDL Particle number, the most widely accepted value that helps guide treatment.

However, the
existence of other hidden-from-view lipid subfractions also often leads to therapies to potentially
improve an individual’s risk.

I believe this includes too many small dense LDL particles (accu -
rately obtained) in the setting of insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome with type II diabetes.

This might include too many small dense LDL particles in the setting of insulin resistance or meta -
bolic syndrome with type 2 diabetes.

Another example of a hidden-from-view lipid abnormality is
the presence of a normal fasting traditional triglyceride value but with the finding of an elevated
large VLDL subfraction.

In this instance, an emphasis might now focus on the need for a lower car -
bohydrate diet and possible further testing of his lipid panel 1–2 hours after a meal.

Some patients
have elevated triglyceride-rich lipoproteins 1–2 hours after eating, placing them at a higher risk.

SUMMARY COMMENTS
1.

Lipid subfraction testing: An opportunity to obtain important information in patients with
an increased risk of CHD.

A hidden-from-view group of atherogenic lipoproteins are often
discovered that leads to specific adjustments designed to reduce an individual’s risk.

2.

Teaching moments with patients: Once on a treatment plan, the discovery of improve -
ment or lack of improvement in a patient’s lipid subfraction testing data allows for “teach -
ing moments” with patients.

These conversations can enhance the patient’s understanding
leading to improved compliance and success with the various components of the indi -
vidualized treatment plan.

These components include diet, exercise, other lifestyle choices,
nutritional supplement choices and dosages, and drug choices and dosages.

Patients need physicians to choose carefully and wisely for their patients.

The decision to start
a drug, specifically a statin, should be based on a patient’s risk and the ability of the physician
to monitor and reduce that risk safely.

Not to start a patient on a statin who has a high risk of
CHD with the presence of high-risk atherogenic proteins is a missed opportunity at future
cardiovascular risk reduction; not to monitor the patient carefully is a failed responsibility.

INTRODUCTION, NEW CONCEPTS, AND PERSPECTIVES
Dyslipidemia is considered one the of top five risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), along with
hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, and obesity.1 There are an infinite number of vascular
insults but only three finite responses of vascular endothelium, and vascular and cardiac smooth mus -
cles.

The mechanisms by which certain lipids induce vascular damage are complex, but from a patho -
physiologic and functional medicine viewpoint, the three finite responses are inflammation, oxidative
stress, and autoimmune dysfunction.2–4 These pathophysiologic mechanisms lead to endothelial dys -
function and vascular smooth muscle and cardiac dysfunction.

The vascular consequences are CVD,
coronary heart disease (CHD), myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebrovascular accidents (CVA).4
Genetics, chronic inflammatory micro and macronutrient intake, obesity (visceral obesity), chronic
infections, toxins and some specific pharmacological agents such as selective beta blockers and
diuretics, tobacco products, DM, and lack of exercise contribute to dyslipidemia.5 For example, sev -
eral genetic phenotypes, such as apolipoprotein E (APO-E), result in variable serum lipid responses
to diet, as well as CHD and MI risk.6,7 In addition, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) proteomics that
affect PON-1 (paroxonase-1) and SR-BI (scavenger receptor B-1) increase CVD.8 The Sortilin I allele
variants on Chromosome 1p13 increases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and CHD risk by 29%.9
Recent studies suggest that increasing dietary cholesterol intake will not alter serum total cho -
lesterol (TC) or LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels or CHD significantly.

Some saturated fats depend -
ing on their carbon chain length have a minimal influence on serum lipids and CHD risk, whereas
monounsaturated and omega-3 polyunsaturated fats have a favorable influence on serum lipids and
CHD risk.

Increased refined carbohydrate intake, may be more important in changing serum lipids
and lipid subfractions than saturated fats and cholesterol.

Refined carbohydrates have more adverse
effects on insulin resistance, atherogenic LDL, small dense LDL, LDL particle number (LDL-P),
VLDL, triglycerides (TGs), total HDL, HDL subfractions, and HDL particle number (HDL-P),
thus contributing to CHD risk more than saturated fats.5,10–16 Postprandial hyperglycemia, hypertri -
glyceridemia, and endotoxemia coupled with inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune vascular
dysfunction is highly associated with atherosclerosis.17–20 Activation of chylomicron and cholecys -
tokinin, GLP-1, low nitric oxide (NO), elevated asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), increased
lipid peroxidation, inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and stimula -
tion of nuclear factor kB (NFkB), pattern recognition receptors (PRR), toll-like receptors (TLR 2
and 4) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain ( NOD) -like receptors (NLR), caveolae and
lipid rafts increase the inflammatory pathways after meals inducing endothelial dysfunction.17–20
Increased dietary intake of sodium chloride, not balanced with potassium further increases the endo -
thelial dysfunction ( ED) and ADMA and reduces NO.

Many phytoalexins, phytonutrients, and poly -
phenols may block the TLR and NLR inflammatory response.21,22 In addition, a “metabolic memory”
of cells and the blood vessel exists due to an innate immune response with increased inflammation.

These responses are perpetuated long after the original insult and are heightened with smaller insults.17
The validity of the “Diet Heart Hypothesis” that implies that dietary saturated fats, dietary choles -
terol, and eggs increase the risk of CHD has been questioned.11–13 Trans fatty acids (trans FAs) have
definite adverse effects and increase CVD and CHD risk, but omega-3 FAS and monounsaturated
fats improve serum lipids and reduce CVD risk.5,10,12,14–16 Trans fats suppress TGF-B responsiveness
that increases the deposition of cholesterol into cellular plasma membranes in vascular tissue.15
Expanded lipid profiles that measure lipids, lipid subfractions, particle size and number, and
APO-B and A are preferred to standard obsolete lipid profiles that measure only the TC, LDL, TG,
or HDL.

These expanded lipid profiles such as the LPP (lipoprotein particles; Spectracell labs),
NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) (LipoScience, Raleigh, North Carolina), Berkley Heart Labs
and VAP (vertical auto profile) (Atherotec, Birmingham, Alabama) improve serum lipid analysis
and CHD risk profiling.23,24
It is now proven that LDL-P value over 700 is the primary lipid parameter that drives the risk for
CHD and MI as well as coronary artery calcification (CAC) as measured by computed tomography 77 The Role of Nutrition and Nutritional Supplements in the Treatment of Dyslipidemia
(CT) angiogram.25,26 Dense LDL type B or LDL type 3 or 4 have a secondary role in CHD only
if the LDL–P is elevated over 700–900 .

Dysfunctional HDL27–30 may become inflammatory, ath -
erogenic and lose its atheroprotective effects especially in patients with DM, metabolic syndrome,
and obesity due to the vascular inflammatory effects of cardiometabolic syndrome.30 Oxidation
and inflammation of APO-A1 often results in higher levels of HDL that are dysfunctional and
not protective.30 The ability to evaluate HDL functionality, either directly or indirectly, measuring
reverse cholesterol transport28 or myeloperoxidase (MPO)29,30 will allow even better assessment of
dyslipidemia-induced vascular disease, CHD risk, and treatment.

An understanding of the pathophysiological steps in dyslipidemia-induced vascular damage is
mandatory for optimal and logical treatment (Figure 5.1).

The ability to interrupt all of the various
steps in this pathway will allow more specific functional and metabolic medicine treatments to
reduce vascular injury, improve vascular repair systems, and to maintain or restore vascular health.

Native LDL, especially large type A LDL, is not usually atherogenic until modified.

However,
there exists an alternate pinocytosis mechanism that allows macrophage ingestion of native LDL,
which accounts for up to 30% of foam cell formation in the subendothelium that occur during
chronic inflammation or infections.31,32
For example, decreasing LDL modification, the atherogenic form of LDL-C, though decreases
in oxidized (oxLDL), glycated (glyLDL), glyco-oxidized LDL (gly-oxLDL) and acetylated LDL
(acLDL), decreasing the uptake of modified LDL into macrophages by the scavenger receptors
(CD 36 SR), decreasing the inflammatory, oxidative stress and autoimmune responses will reduce
vascular damage beyond just treating the LDL-C level.33–38 There are at least 38 mechanistic
pathways that can be treated to interrupt the dyslipidemia-induced vascular damage and disease
(Table 5.1).

Reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), an inflammatory marker,
reduces vascular events independent of reductions in LDL-C through numerous mechanisms.39

Many patients cannot or will not use pharmacologic treatments such as statins, fibrates, bile
acid resin binders, or ezetimibe to treat dyslipidemia.5 Statin-induced or fibrate-induced  muscle
disease, abnormal liver function tests, neuropathy, memory loss, mental status changes, gastrointes -
tinal disturbances, glucose intolerance, or DM are some of the reasons.41–44 However, many patients
have other clinical symptoms or lab abnormalities such as chronic fatigue,  exercise-induced fatigue,
myalgias, muscle weakness, memory loss, decrease lean muscle mass, reduced exercise tolerance,
reductions on Coenzyme Q10 carnitine, vitamin E, vitamin D, omega-3 FAs, selenium and free T3
levels (hypothyroidism) with prolonged usage, or the administration of high-dose statins.5,40,45–52 New
treatment approaches that combine weight loss, reduction in visceral and total body fat, increase in
lean muscle mass, optimal aerobic and resistance exercise,  scientifically proven nutrition, and use of
nutraceutical supplements offer not only improvement in serum lipids but also reductions in inflam -
mation, oxidative stress, immune dysfunction, and endothelial and vascular smooth muscle dysfunc -
tion.

In addition, surrogate markers for vascular disease or clinical vascular target organ damage
such as CHD and carotid intimal medial thickness ( IMT)  are reduced in many clinical trials.5
NUTRACEUTICAL SUPPLEMENTS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA
Nutraceutical supplement management of dyslipidemia has been infrequently reviewed.5,53,54 New
important scientific information and clinical studies are required to understand the present role
of these natural agents in the management of dyslipidemia.5,53,54 Studies include clinical trials
that show excellent reductions in serum lipids and CHD with niacin, omega-3 FAs, red yeast rice,
fiber and alpha linolenic acid (ALA), and smaller studies using surrogate vascular markers such as
carotid intimal medial thickness and obstruction, plaque progression, CAC score by electron beam
tomography (EBT) and CT angiogram, generalized atherosclerosis, and endothelial function.5,54–56
The proposed mechanisms of action of some of the nutraceutical supplements on the mammalian
cholesterol pathway are shown in Figure 5.2.

niacin (vitaMin b3)
Niacin has a dose-related effect (1–4 g/day) in reducing TC, LDL, APO-B, LDL-P, TGs, VLDL,
increasing LDL size from small type B to large type A, increasing HDL especially the protective
and larger HDL 2b particle and APO-A1).5 However, niacin does not increase HDL-P (the predomi -
nant protective lipid parameter) much, if at all.57,58 Niacin has a logarithmic dose–response on HDL
with smaller doses having a large effect, but the effect on LDL reduction is a linear dose–response
that requires higher doses.57
The changes are dose related and vary from about 10%–30% for each lipid, including HDL,
LDL and triglycerides.5,59,60 Niacin inhibits LDL oxidation, increases TG lipolysis in adipose tis -
sue, increases APO-B degradation, reduces the fractional catabolic rate of HDL–APO-A1, inhibits
platelet function, induces fibrinolysis, decreases cytokines, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), lowers
Lp(a), increases adiponectin—which provides antioxidant activity, inhibits cholesterol ester transfer
protein ( CETP) , and increases reverse cholesterol transport.5,57,59,60 However, despite an improved
lipid profile and all other parameters, there is no improvement in endothelial or microvascular func -
tion.61 Randomized clinical trials such as the Coronary Drug Project, HATS trial, ARBITOR 2,
Oxford Niaspan Study, FATS, CLAS I and CLAS II, and AFRS have shown reduction in coronary
events, decreases in coronary atheroma (plaque) and decreases in carotid IMT.5,59,60,62–65 The recent
negative findings in the AIMHIGH study66,67 do not detract from these positive clinical trials, as
this study has numerous methodological design flaws and was not powered to statistically determine
CVD endpoints.

The recent THRIVE trial of 26,000 patients using 2 g of extended-release niacin plus the anti -
flushing agent laropiprant daily or placebo on top of a background therapy of simvastatin with or
without ezetimibe did not reduce CV events despite an increased HDL of 17% and decreased LDL
of 20%.68,69 Whether the inhibition of flushing by laropiprant or some other unknown effect of this
agent interfered with the HDL function and the CV outcomes is not clear.

However, the recommen -
dation by some not to use niacin in face of other positive studies is clearly premature.

The effective dosing range is from 500 to 4000 mg/day.

Only vitamin B3 (niacin) is effective in
dyslipidemia.

The nonflush niacin (inositol hexanicotinate-IHN) does not improve lipid profiles,
and is not recommended.5,70 The side effects of niacin include hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, gout,
hepatitis, flushing, rash, pruritus, hyperpigmentation, hyperhomocysteinemia, gastritis, ulcers,
bruising, tachycardia, and palpitations.5,59,60 Elevations in homocysteine should be treated with vita -
min B6, B12, and folate.

Niacin-induced flushing is minimized by increasing the dose gradually,
taking on a regular basis without missing doses, taking with meals, avoiding alcohol within 4 hours
of ingestion of niacin, consumption of 81 mg baby aspirin, and supplemental quercetin, apples or
apple pectin or sauce.5
Policosanol
Policosanol is a sugar cane extract of eight aliphatic alcohols that has undergone extensive clinical
studies with variable results.5 Most of the earlier studies that showed positive results performed in
Cuba have been questioned as to their validity.5,54,71,72
The more recent double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials have not shown any significant
improvement in any measured lipids including TC, LDL, TG, or HDL.

Policosanol is not recom -
mended at this time for the treatment of any form of dyslipidemia.5,54,71,72
red yeast rice
Red yeast rice—RYR ( Monascus purpureus ) is a fermented product of rice that contains mono -
colins, which inhibit cholesterol synthesis via 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl ( HMG)  CoA reduc -
tase and thus has “statin-like”  properties (13 natural statins).5,54,73–75 RYR also contains ergosterol,
amino acids, flavonoids, trace elements, alkaloids, sterols, isoflavones, and monounsaturated FAs.

81 The Role of Nutrition and Nutritional Supplements in the Treatment of Dyslipidemia
RYR administered orally to adults subjects with dyslipidemia at 2400 mg/day reduced LDL-C
by 22% ( p < .001), TG by 12% with little change in HDL.5,54,73 RYR reduces the risk of abdomi -
nal aortic aneurysms (AAA) by suppressing angiotensin II levels.74 In a recent placebo-controlled
Chinese study of 5000 subjects over 4.5 years, an extract of RYR reduced LDL 17.6% (p < .001) and
increased HDL 4.2% ( p < .001).75
A highly purified and certified RYR must be used to avoid potential renal damage induced by
mycotoxin and citrinin.5,54,73
The recommended dose is 2400–4800 mg of a standardized RYR.

Although reductions in
Coenzyme Q 10 may occur in predisposed patients and those on prolonged high-dose RYR due
to its weaker “statin-like” effect.

RYR is an excellent alternative to patients with statin-induced
myopathy.5,54,73
Plant sterols  (PHytosterols )
The plant sterols, which are similar to cholesterol molecules, are naturally occurring sterols of plant
origin that include B-sitosterol (the most abundant), campesterol, stigmasterol (4-desmethyl sterols
of the cholestane series), and the stanols, which are saturated.5,54,76–78 The plant sterols are much
better absorbed than the plant stanols.

The daily intake of plant sterols in the United States is about
150–400 mg/day mostly from soybean oil, various nuts, and tall pine tree oil.54 These have a dose-
dependent reduction in serum lipids.77 TC is decreased 8%, LDL is decreased 10% (range 6%–15%)
with no change in TG and HDL on doses of 2–3 g/day in divided doses with meals.5,54,76,77 A recent
meta-analysis of 84 trials showed that an average intake of 2.15 g/day reduced LDL by 8.8% with no
improvement with higher doses.77 The mechanism of action is primarily to decrease the incorpora -
tion of dietary and biliary cholesterol into micelles due to lower micellar solubility of cholesterol,
which reduces cholesterol absorption and increases bile acid secretion.

In addition, there is an inter -
action with enterocyte ATP-binding cassette transport proteins (ABCG8 and ABCG5) that directs
cholesterol back into the intestinal lumen.5,54,76 The only difference between cholesterol and sitosterol
consists of an additional ethyl group at position C-24 in sitosterol, which is responsible for its poor
absorption.

The plant sterols have a higher affinity than cholesterol for the micelles.

Patients that
have the rare homozygote mutations of the ATP-binding cassette are hyperabsorbers of sitosterol
(absorb 15%–60% instead of the normal 5%) and will develop premature atherosclerosis.54 This is a
rare autosomal recessive disorder termed sitosterolemia.

The plant sterols are also anti-inflammatory
and decrease the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as HS-CRP, IL-6, IL1b, TNF alpha, PLA
2, and fibrinogen, but these effects vary among the various phytosterols.78,79 Other potential mecha -
nisms include modulation of signaling pathways, activation of cellular stress responses, growth arrest,
reduction of APO-B48 secretion from intestinal and hepatic cells, reduction of cholesterol synthesis
with suppression of HMG COA reductase and CYP7A1, interference with sterol regulatory element-
binding protein ( SREBP) , and promotion of reverse cholesterol transport via ATP-binding cassette
transporter (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 1 (ABCG1).79 The biological
activity of phytosterols is both cell-type and sterol specific.79
The plant sterols can interfere with absorption of lipid-soluble compounds such as fat soluble
vitamins and carotenoids such as vitamins D, E, and K, and alpha carotene.5,54 Some studies have
shown reduction in atherosclerosis progression, reduced carotid IMT, and decreased plaque pro -
gression, but the results have been conflicting.5,54 There are no studies on CHD or other CVD out -
comes.

The recommended dose is about 2–2.5 g/day (average 2.15 g/day).

soy
Numerous studies have shown mild improvements in serum lipids with soy at doses of about
30–50 g/day.5,54,80,81  TC decreased 2%–9.3%, LDL decreased 4%–12.9%, TG decreased 10.5%,
and HDL increased up to 2.4%.

However, the studies are conflicting due to differences in the 82 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
type and dose of soy used in the studies, as well as nonstandardized methodology.5,54,94,95 Soy
decreases the micellar content and absorption of lipids through a combination of fiber, isoflavones
(genistin, glycitin, and diadzin) and phytoestrogens.5,54,80,81 Soy also reduces SREBP, HMG-COA
reductase, increases LDL receptor density, and increases the antioxidant activity of SOD and
catalase.

Most reduction is seen with soy-enriched isoflavones with soy protein.

Fermented soy
is preferred.

green tea extract  and green tea
Catechins, especially epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG) , may improve the lipid profile by
interfering with micellar  solubilization of cholesterol in the GI tract and reduce absorption.5 In
addition, EGCG reduces the FA gene expression, inhibits HMG CoA reductase, increases mito -
chondrial energy expenditure, reduces oxLDL, increases PON-1, upregulates the LDL receptor,
decreases APO-B  lipoprotein secretion from cells, mimics the action of insulin, improves endo -
thelial dysfunction, activates Nrf2, increases heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, decreases
inflammation, displaces  caveolin-1 from cell membranes, increases NO, reduces endothelial
inflammation, and decreases body fat.5,82–85
A meta-analysis of human studies of 14 trials show that EGCG at 224–674 mg/day or 60 oz of
green tea per day reduced TC 7.2 mg/dL and LDL 2.19 mg/dL ( p < .001 for both).

There was no
significant change in HDL or TG levels.86 The recommended dose is a standardized EGCG extract
500–1000 mg/day.

oMega-3 F atty acids
Observational, epidemiologic, and controlled clinical trials have shown significant reductions in
serum TG, VLDL, decreased LDL-P, and increased LDL and HDL particle size as well as major
reductions in all CVD events.5,87–94 The DART trial demonstrated a decrease in mortality of 29%
in men post MI and the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’Infarto ( GISSI)
prevention trial found a decrease in total mortality of 20%, CV deaths of 30% and sudden death of
45%.

The Kuppio Heart Study demonstrated a 44% reduction in fatal and nonfatal CHD in subjects
in the highest quintile of omega-3 intake compared to the lowest quintile.5,87,88 Omega-3 FA reduce
CHD progression, stabilize plaque, reduce coronary artery stent restenosis, and coronary artery
bypass graft eicosapentaenoic acid ( CABG)  occlusion.5,89 In the JELIS study, the addition of 1.8
g of omega EPA to a statin resulted in an additional 19 % relative risk reduction (RRR ) in major
coronary events and nonfatal MI and a 20% decrease in CVA.5,90 There is a dose-related reduction
in VLDL of up to 50%, TG of up to 50%, with little to no change or decrease in total TC, LDL,
APO-B and no change to slight increase in HDL.5,91–94 However, the number of LDL particles
decrease and LDL particle size increases from small type B to large type A (increase of 25 nm).

The antiatherogenic HDL 2b is also increases by up to 29%.

The rate of entry of VLDL particles
into the circulation is decreased and APO-CIII is reduced which allows lipoprotein lipase to be
more active.26 There is a decrease in remnant chylomicrons and remnant lipoproteins.5,92 Patients
with LDL over 100 mg% usually have reductions in total LDL and those that are below 80 mg%
have mild increases.93 However, in both cases, the LDL-P decreases, the dense LDL B increases
in size to the less atherogenic LDL A particle and APO-B levels decrease.

There is a net decrease
in the concentration of cholesterol carried by all atherogenic particles and decreases in non-HDL-
C. Omega-3 FA are anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, lower BP and heart rate, improve heart
rate variability,5,87 decrease FA synthesis, increase FA oxidation, and reduce body fat and weight.5
Omega-3 FAs are one of the only substances that lower lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2
(Lp-LPA2).26
Insulin resistance is improved and there are no significant changes in fasting glucose or
hemoglobin A1C with long-term treatment.95 Doses of 3 g/day of combined EPA and DHA at a 3:2 83 The Role of Nutrition and Nutritional Supplements in the Treatment of Dyslipidemia
ratio with GLA at 50% of the total EPA and DHA content and 700 mg of gamma/delta tocopherol
at 80% and 20% alpha tocopherol per 3 g of DHA and EPA are recommended.5 DHA and EPA may
have variable but favorable effects on the various lipid levels.5,91,92,95, 96 EPA does not usually increase
LDL, is less effective in lowering TG than DHA but does not alter the LDL and HDL particle size.

However, DHA may increase total LDL, but increases LDL and HDL size and lowers TG more.96
The combination of plant sterols and omega-3 FAs are synergistic in improving lipids and inflam -
mation.94 New free FA forms of omega-3 FAs have a fourfold greater area under the plasma n-3
PUFA curve than prescription Lovaza and thus a more potent reduction in TG levels.96 The data of
krill oil on dyslipidemia is limited to only one study in which a dose-related response to LDL-C
reduction up to 39%, TG reduction of 27%, and HDL increase of 60% was found.97 These findings
with krill oil require confirmation with additional controlled trials.

Flax
Flax seeds and flax lignan complex with SDG (secoisolariciresinol diglucoside) and increased
intake of ALA from other sources such as walnuts have been shown in several meta-analyses to
reduce TC and LDL by 5%–15%, Lp(a) by 14%, TG by up to 36% with either no change or a slight
reduction in HDL.5,98–100 These properties do not apply to flax seed oil.

In the Seven Countries study,
CHD was reduced with increased consumption of ALA.

In the Seven Countries study,
CHD was reduced with increased consumption of ALA.

In the Lyon diet trial at the end of 4 years,
intake of flax reduced CHD and total deaths by 50%–70%.5 Flax seeds contain fiber and lignins and
decrease the levels of 7 alpha hydroylase and acyl CoA cholesterol transferase.5,98–100 Flax seeds and
ALA are anti-inflammatory, reduce HS-CRP, decrease TG, increase HDL, decrease insulin resis -
tance and risk of type 2 DM, reduce visceral obesity and systolic BP, increase eNOS, and improve
endothelial dysfunction.

Flax contains phytoestrogens, decreases vascular smooth muscle hyper -
trophy, reduces oxidative stress, increases cholesterol efflux in macrophage-derived foam cells by
decreasing stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 expressions and farnesoid X receptor mechanism of action,
and retard development of atherosclerosis.5,98–102 The dose required for these effects is from 14 to 40
g of flax seeds per day.5,98–100 Chia seeds ( Salvia hispanica ) are the richest botanical source of ALA
at 60% wt/volume.101 The dose of chia seeds is 25 g/day.

Monounsaturated  Fats
Monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) such as olives, olive oil, and nuts reduce LDL by 5%–10%, lower
TG by 10%–15%, increase HDL by 5%, decrease oxLDL, reduce oxidation and inflammation,
improve ED, lower BP, decrease thrombosis and reduce the incidence of CHD ( Mediterranean
diet).5,103–107 MUFA reduces CD40L gene expression and its downstream products (IL23a, adrener -
gic B-2 receptor, oxLDL receptor 1, IL-8 receptor) and related genes involved in atherogenic and
inflammatory process in vivo in humans.107 MUFA are one of the most potent agents to reduce
oxLDL in humans.

The equivalent of 3–4 tablespoons (40–50 g) per day of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) with
MUFA  content is recommended for the maximum effect in conjunction with omega-3 FAs .

However, the caloric intake of this amount of MUFA must be balanced with the other beneficial
effects.

sesaMe
Sesame at 40 g/day reduces LDL by 9% through inhibition of intestinal absorption, increasing
biliary secretion, decreasing HMG CoA reductase activity, upregulating the LDL receptor gene,
upregulating 7 alpha hydroxylase gene expression, and upregulating the SREBP 2 genes.108,109
A randomized placebo-controlled crossover study of 26 postmenopausal women who consumed
50 g of sesame powder daily for 5 weeks had a 5% decrease in TC and a 10% decrease in LDL-C.10884 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
tocotrienols
Tocotrienols are a family of unsaturated forms of vitamin E termed alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.5
The gamma and delta tocotrienols lower TC up to 17%, LDL 24%, APO-B 15%, and Lp(a) 17% with
minimal changes in HDL or APO-A1 in 50% of subjects at doses of 200 mg/day given at night with
food.5,110–112 The gamma/delta form of tocotrienols inhibits cholesterol synthesis by suppression of
HMG-CoA reductase activity by two posttranscriptional actions.5,110–112 These include increased
controlled degradation of the reductase protein and decreased efficiency of translation of HMG CoA
reductase mRNA.

These effects are mediated by sterol binding of the reductase enzyme to the endo -
plasmic reticulum membrane proteins called INSIGS.111 The tocotrienols have natural farnesylated
analogues of tocopherols, which give them their effects on HMG CoA reductase.111 In addition, the
LDL receptor is augmented and they exhibit antioxidant activity.

The tocotrienol dose is very important as increased dosing will induce its own metabolism and
reduce effectiveness, whereas lower doses are not as effective.5 Also, concomitant intake (less than
12 hours) of alpha tocopherol reduces tocotrienol absorption.

Increased intake of alpha tocopherol
over 20% of total tocopherols may interfere with the lipid-lowering effect.5,110
Tocotrienols are metabolized by successive beta oxidation and then catalyzed by the CYP P450
enzymes 3A4 and CYP 4F2.5 The combination of a statin with gamma/delta tocotrienols further
reduces LDL-C by 10%.110 The tocotrienols block the adaptive response of upregulation of HMG-
CoA reductase secondary to competitive inhibition by the statins.5,110 Carotid artery stenosis regres -
sion has been reported in about 30% of subjects given tocotrienols over 18 months.

They also slow
progression of generalized atherosclerosis.5,112 The recommended dose is 200 mg of gamma delta
tocotrienol at night with food.

Pantet Hine
Pantethine is the disulfide derivative of pantothenic acid and is metabolized to cystamine-SH, which
is the active form in treating dyslipidemia.5,113–117 Over 28 clinical trials have shown consistent and
significant improvement in serum lipids.

TC is decreased 15%, LDL by 20%, APO-B by 27.6%, and
TG by 36.5% over 4–9 months.

HDL and APO-A1 are increased 8%.5,113–118 The effects on lipids
are slow with peak effects at 4 months but may take up to 6–9 months.5,113–118 In addition, pante -
thine reduces lipid peroxidation of LDL, decreases lipid deposition, intimal thickening and fatty
streak formation in the aorta and coronary arteries.5,113–117 Pantethine inhibits cholesterol synthesis
and accelerates FA metabolism in the mitochondria by inhibiting hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
increases CoA in the cytoplasm, which stimulates the oxidation of acetate at the expense of FA and
cholesterol synthesis, and increases the Krebs cycle activity.5,113–117 In addition, cholesterol esterase
activity increases and HMG-CoA reductase activity is decreased.5,113–117 There is 50% inhibition of

The recommended effective dose is 300 mg three times per day or 450 mg twice
per day with or without food.5,113–118
gugguli Pids
Guggulipids are resins from the Mukul myrrh tree ( Commiphora wightii ) that contain active
lipid-lowering compounds called guggulsterones.5,119–121 These increase hepatic LDL receptors, bile
acid secretion, and decrease cholesterol synthesis in animal experiments.5,119 However,  controlled
human clinical trials have not shown these agents to be effective in improving serum lipids.119–121
One study of 103 subjects on 50–75 mg of guggulsterones per day for 8 weeks actually had a 5%
increase in LDL, no change in TC, TG, or HDL, and insignificant reductions in Lp(a) and HS-CRP.119
Guggulipids are not recommended at this time.85 The Role of Nutrition and Nutritional Supplements in the Treatment of Dyslipidemia
garlic
Numerous placebo-controlled clinical trials in humans indicate reductions in TC and LDL of
about 9%–12% at doses of 600–900 mg/day of a standardized extract of allicin and ajoene.5,122,123
Many studies have been poorly controlled and use variable types and doses of garlic, which have
given inconsistent results.5,122,123 Aged garlic (AGE) has shown the best results related to improve -
ment in serum lipids as well as lowering BP, improving endothelial function and arterial elasticity,
decreasing CAC and plaque progression, and lowering HS-CRP.5,56,122–126 Garlic reduces intestinal
cholesterol absorption, inhibits enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis, and deactivates HMG
COA reductase.5,122 In addition, AGE reduces vascular smooth muscle proliferation and transfor -
mation; decreases oxidative stress and inflammation; decreases oxLDL; prevents entry of lipids
into the arterial wall and macrophages; increases eNOS and NO; increases glutathione, glutathi -
one reductase, and superoxide dismutase; has fibrinolytic activity and antiplatelet activity.5,56,122
AGE has been used in these studies alone or in conjunction with B vitamins, folate, arginine, and
statins.123–126
resveratrol
Resveratrol reduces oxLDL; inhibits ACAT activity and cholesterol ester formation; increases
bile acid  excretion; reduces TC, TG, and LDL; increases PON-1 activity and HDL; inhibits
NADPH  oxidase in macrophages and blocks the uptake of modified LDL by CD36 SR (scavenger
receptors).127,128 N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has this same effect on CD 36 DR and should be used in
conjunction with resveratrol.127 The dose of trans-resveratrol is 250 mg/day and NAC is 1000 mg
twice per day.

curcu Min
Curcumin is a phenolic compound in turmeric.5,129 It induces changes in the expression of genes
involved in cholesterol synthesis such as the LDL receptor mRNA, HMG CoA reductase, SREBP,
cholesterol 7 alpha hydrolyze, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ( PPAR), liver X recep -
tors  (LXR) , affects the expression of genes involved in leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial
migration to inhibit atherosclerosis.5,129,130 In one human study of 10 patients consuming 500 mg/day
of curcumin, the HDL increased 29% and total cholesterol decreased 12%.5,129 This needs confirma -
tion in larger randomized clinical trials.

PoMegranate
Pomegranate increases PON 1 binding to HDL and increases PON 2 in macrophages, which
improves the function of HDL cholesterol and increases reverse cholesterol transport.

It is a
potent   antioxidant, increases total antioxidant status (TAS), lowers oxLDL, decreases antibod -
ies to oxLDL, inhibits platelet function, reduces glycosylated LDL, decreases macrophage LDL
uptake, reduces lipid deposition in the arterial wall, decreases progression of carotid artery IMT,
and lowers blood pressure especially in subjects with the highest oxidative stress, known carotid
artery plaque, and the greatest abnormalities in TG and HDL levels.131–136 Consuming about 8 oz of
pomegranate juice per day or 1–2 cups of pomegranate seeds is recommended.

Citrus Bergamia
Citrus bergamia  has been evaluated in several clinical prospective trials in humans.

In doses of
1000 mg/day, this compound lowers LDL up to 36%, TG up to 39%, increases HDL up to 40% by
inhibiting HMG CoA reductase, increases cholesterol and bile acid excretion, reduces ROS and 86 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
oxLDL, improves glucose via AMPK and GLUT 4 receptor, reduces weight, and binds to the ACAT
receptor.137–139 The active ingredients include naringin, neroeriocitrin, neohesperidin, poncerin,
rutin, neodesmin, rhoifolin, melitidine, and brutelidine.137,139
vitaMin c
Vitamin C supplementation lowers serum LDL-C and TGs.140 A meta-analysis of 13 randomized
controlled trials in subjects given at least 500 mg of vitamin C daily for 3–24 weeks found a reduc -
tion in LDL-C of 7.9 mg/dL ( p < .0001) TG reduction of 20.1 mg/dL ( p < .003).

HDL did not
change.

The reductions in LDL and TG were greatest in those with the highest initial lipid levels
and the lowest serum vitamin C levels.141
lycoPene
Lycopene is an acyclic carotenoid with a high concentration in tomatoes.

It has been shown in tissue culture to inhibit HMG CoA reductase; induce Rho inactivation;
increase PPAR gamma, LXR receptor, and RXR activities; increase reverse cholesterol transport
and efflux with ABCA1, APO-AI expression and caveolin-1 expression, increase HDL 2 and 3,
improve HDL functionality, reduce SAA, decrease CETP, increase PON 1, and reduce inflamma -
tion in humans.142–144 This reduces intracellular cholesterol and lowers cholesterol in lipid domains,
which alters membrane-induced cellular signal transduction.

The two unconjugated double bonds in
the lycopene molecule have high activity against ROS.

Higher serum lycopene levels are associated
with reduction in carotid IMT and carotid atherosclerosis.145
Probiotics
Mixed high-dose probiotics at 60–100 billion organisms per day reduce TC by 9%, LDL-C by 8%,
and TG by 10%.146,147 Probiotics precipitate bile salts, deconjugate bile salts, and are incorporated
into cell membranes and into the assimilation of cholesterol.

berberine  Hcl
Berberine HCL is an alkaloid present in roots, rhizomes, and stem barks of selected plants.148–150 In
a study of 32 dyslipidemic patients, 500 mg/day of berberine HCL decreased TC by 29%, LDL-C by
25%, and TG by 35% in 3 months.149 Berberine increases hepatic LDL-R and is additive to statins in
its lipid-lowering effect.148,149 The recommended dose is 500 mg/day to bid.

Berberine has additive
LDL-lowering effects with statins148 and ezetimibe.150 However, berberine is more effective and has
fewer adverse effects compared to ezetimibe monotherapy.

coMbinations
A recent prospective open-label human clinical trial of 30 patients for 2 months, which is not as
rigorous as a placebo-controlled trial, showed significant improvement in serum lipids using a
proprietary product with a combination of pantethine, plant sterols, EGCG, gamma/delta toco -
trienols, and phytolens.151 There was a reduction of TC by 14%, LDL by 14%, VLDL by 20%,
and small dense LDL particles by 25% (type III and IV) (100).

In another study using the same
proprietary product with RYR 2400 mg/day and niacin 500 mg/day, the TC dropped by 34%,
LDL decreased by 34%, LDL-P dropped by 35%, VLDL dropped by 27%, and HDL increased by
10% (Houston MC, Personal Communication, 2011).

NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA
Nutrition is an important treatment for dyslipidemia, CHD risk factors, and for the prevention
and treatment of CVD.

Numerous epidemiological studies and prospective clinical trials includ -
ing the Framingham Heart Study,154,155 Seven Countries Study,156,157 Pritikin diet studies,158–160
Ornish Lifestyle Heart Trial,161–164 Omni Heart Trial,155 Portfolio diet,165–168 MD,169–172 Lyon Diet
Heart Study,172 Indian Heart Study,173 Predimed study,174,175 and Paleolithic diet have clearly
established the relationship between diet, serum lipids, inflammation, and CVD including CHD
and stroke.

Three cohorts of the Framingham Heart Study with over 10,000 subjects have demonstrated
improved CV risk on lipid lowering diets that decrease total and LDL-C, TG, and increase
HDL.154,155 The Seven Countries Study was an international study that investigated lifestyle and
diet.156,157 A high fat diet increased prevalence of CVD.

The Pritikin Principle Diet, which included
low-fat diet (10% of total calories) with primarily vegetables, grains, and fruits, combined with
exercise, improved the lipid profile.158–160
Ornish evaluated an intensive therapeutic approach that combined a low fat (10% total calories,
low cholesterol of 10 mg/day, complex carbohydrate, low refined carbohydrate vegetarian diet, exer -
cise, and other lifestyle changes such as stress reduction, smoking cessation, and group psychosocial
support).161–164 The experimental group compared to the control group had statistically significant
reductions in LDL-C, frequency of angina episodes, and regression in coronary artery stenosis at
years 1 and 5.

The Optimal Macronutrient Intake for Heart Health Trial (OmniHeart Trial) was a randomized
controlled intervention crossover study of 164 adults using a Mediterranean-style diet to evaluate
plasma lipids and blood pressure.155 Three diets were included—a carbohydrate-rich diet, a protein-
rich diet with 50% from plant sources, and a diet rich in monounsaturated fat.

The monounsaturated
fat-rich diet increased HDL-C levels, lowered TG, with no change in LDL-C.

The protein-rich diet
decreased LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C compared to the carbohydrate diet.

Substitution of the carbo -
hydrates with either proteins or monounsaturated fat lowered blood pressure, improved serum lipid
levels, and reduced CV risk.168
The Portfolio Diet Study was a randomized control trial of 14 dyslipidemic subjects165 given a
vegetarian diet, with additional soluble fiber, nuts, soy protein, and plant sterols.

At 4 weeks, the
LDL-C dropped by 29.6% and TG by 9.3% in the diet group versus 8.5% in the control group.

There was a 33.3% decrease in LDL-C and 11% decrease in TG in those given a statin drug.

At 4 weeks, the
LDL-C dropped by 29.6% and TG by 9.3% in the diet group versus 8.5% in the control group.

There was a 33.3% decrease in LDL-C and 11% decrease in TG in those given a statin drug.

In
a follow-up study of the Portfolio diet in 66 dyslipidemic adults for 1 year, 31 participants had
reductions in LDL-C > 20% related to compliance with the diet.166 The most recent Portfolio diet

The Lyon Diet Heart Study was the first randomized single-blind secondary prevention
trial 600 participants over 4 years with a prior MI to investigate the effect of a Mediterranean-style
diet on CVD.170–172 The primary outcome measurement of fatal or nonfatal MI was significantly
reduced.

For example, the total fat in the experimental diet was 30.5% but had only 12.5% MUFA
and was enriched in ALA, an omega-3 polyunsaturated fat.

The recent 4.8-year study of 7447 sub -
jects given the MD in primary prevention of CVD found a 28%–30% reduction in major CV events
in those on the MD with EVOO or nuts.176
The Indian Heart Study was a one year evaluation of a Mediterranean-style diet enriched in
ALA administered to the treated group, while the control group was advised on smoking cessa -
tion, stress management, regular exercise, reduction of dietary fat and alcohol.173 Compared to the
control group, the treated group had a 38% reduction in nonfatal MI and a 32% reduction in fatal
MI.

The Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED)174 was a 3 month randomized cross-
sectional study of 772 asymptomatic Spanish adults at high risk for CVD treated with one of 3
diets.

A control group and two experimental arms that used a Mediterranean-style diets, differing
only in the primary fat source: EVOO at 1 L/week or mixed nuts at 30 g/day.

The treated groups
showed a reduction in the TC:HDL-C ratio, at –0.38 (95% CI, –0.55 to –0.22) for those on the
Mediterranean/EVOO diet and of –0.26 (95% CI, –0.42 to –0.10) for those on the Mediterranean/
nuts diet.

In addition, four inflammatory markers were significantly reduced in the EVOO group
including HS-CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular
cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).

All but the HS-CRP were reduced in the nut consumption
group.174,175
The hunter–gatherer diet or Paleolithic diet177–178 is considered close to human ancestral diet and
consisted of a diet high in foliage, leafy vegetables, fruits, seeds, nuts, plant sterols, vegetable pro -
tein, fiber, omega-3 FAs, and lean animal protein that improves lipids and CVD risk.

SUMMARY OF NUTRITION, DYSLIPIDEMIA, AND CVD
Although many questions still exist regarding the optimal intake of fats, the types of fats, types and
quality of protein, and the dietary intake of complex and refined carbohydrates, most studies clearly
indicate that trans FAs and refined carbohydrates have an adverse effect on serum lipids and CV
outcomes.181 Some saturated fats may be adverse, others neutral, and some potentially beneficial.

The MUFA and omega-3 FAs are consistently beneficial for dyslipidemia and CVD.

The vegetarian
diet with increased complex carbohydrates and fiber with lower dietary cholesterol is also benefi -
cial.

Protein intake of lean, wild and organic types of protein, and cold-water fish improves lipids
and CHD risk factors.

Protein intake of lean, wild and organic types of protein, and cold-water fish improves lipids
and CHD risk factors.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The combination of a lipid-lowering diet and selected scientifically proven nutraceutical
supplements have the ability to reduce LDL-C by up to 50%, increase LDL particle size, decrease
LDL-P, lower TG and VLDL, and increase total and type 2 b HDL.

In addition, inflammation,
oxidative stress, and immune responses are decreased.

Many surrogates for vascular target
organ damage are improved, such as carotid IMT and plaque, aortic fatty streaks, CAC, plaque
regression and morphology changes, endothelial function, vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy
and  elasticity, CABG and stent occlusion, and heart rate variability.

Hard CV endpoints are also
improved such as atherosclerosis, CVA, CVD, CHD, MI, abdominal aortic aneurysms, sudden
death, and total mortality.

In several prospective clinical trials, CHD and CVD have been reduced with many of the
nutraceutical supplements such as omega-3 FAs, RYR, ALA, and niacin.

This nutritional and 89 The Role of Nutrition and Nutritional Supplements in the Treatment of Dyslipidemia
nutraceutical supplement treatment is a valid alternative for patients that are statin intolerant, can -
not take other drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia, or in those who prefer alternative treatments.

This new approach to lipid management to decrease vascular disease utilizes a more functional
medicine approach with a broader treatment program that addresses the multitude of steps involved
in dyslipidemia-induced vascular damage (Tables 5.1 through 5.20).

To our benefit, the well-recognized global health concern that is cardiovascular disease (CVD)
seems to have an accessible, effective solution—food.

The component nutrients of what we eat can
be an effective strategy against the CVD morbidity and mortality that affects both men and women
across a variety of ethnic groups.

Over the past decades, increasing numbers of epidemiological
studies have demonstrated an association between dietary patterns and the risk of CVD.

Solidifying
these population findings are prospective clinical trials that have investigated the influence of
dietary interventions on cardiovascular endpoints, with the overall findings indicating beneficial
effects on two major modifiable CVD risk factors, hypertension and elevated low-density lipo -
protein (LDL) cholesterol, as well as reduced inflammatory markers.

In addition, current research
indicates the risk of developing CVD increases twofold with diabetes, a condition linked to obesity
and commonly addressed through nutritional modifications.

These findings have uncovered a more
direct role of glucose dysregulation on vascular health.1,2 As a result, dietary recommendations have
been purported as a means to prevent and treat CVD by opinion leader organizations and cardiolo -
gists in clinical practice.

Although it is beneficial to have knowledge about healthful dietary patterns and the whole
foods they are composed of from a cardiovascular perspective, it is imperative to apply these find -
ings within the context of a personalized approach to the individual beyond the traditional nutri -
tional recommendations established according to age, gender, ethnicity, and pregnancy.

Indeed,
the degree to which a person may respond to the influence of food on their cardiovascular risk
factors is related to a large degree on their genetics and corresponding epigenetics.

Studies over
the past two decades have revealed associations between gene polymorphisms, foods/nutrients,
and risk factors for chronic disease.

More rigorous research is required to delineate how cohorts
of patients with gene variants and subsequent propensity toward CVD respond to an intervention
with select foods and food components.

Preliminary discussion on personalized nutrition for CVD
is establishing a foothold as the scientific literature continues to indicate the following examples
of where this type of approach would be warranted: (1) only about 25% of individuals with hyper -
cholesterolemia respond to dietary cholesterol limitation; (2) various degrees of salt sensitivity
exist in individuals with hypertension; (3) apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype heterogeneity may
result in differential lipid responses to the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)3; (4) genotypes at angiotensinogen, β 2-adrenergic recep -
tor, and kallikrein single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) directly impact the effects of blood
pressure–lowering diets such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH).4
Furthermore, lifestyle and behaviors beyond nutrients need to be taken into account.

As we know
from the INTERHEART study,5 there are nine potentially modifiable risk factors, including life -
style aspects (e.g., exercise, fruit and vegetable intake, smoking, and alcohol) that account for over
90% of the risk of an initial acute myocardial infarction.

Therefore, accounting for a comprehensive,
individualized approach based on lifestyle medicine for the individual with CVD is consistent with
where nutrition science is headed in the twenty-first century.

In this chapter, an overview of the recent science on whole foods, whole food patterns, and food
constituents as they relate to CVD will be discussed, with a focus on nutrigenomic and epigenetic
influences whenever available.

HEART-HEALTHY DIETARY PATTERNS
Individual food components have for a long time been the primary focus of nutritional science,
policy and recommendations; however, it is becoming better appreciated that people eat food, not
nutrients, and that these foods are eaten in complex dietary patterns.6 Placing foods in the context
of a dietary pattern has two major advantages.

Firstly, food components work synergistically to
influence health outcomes and foods, and their components may have additive or more than addi -
tive effects.7 Thus, “food synergy” can act as an operational framework for understanding how
complex dietary patterns may confer unique health effects beyond individual dietary components.8
Secondly, a food-focused, as opposed to nutrient-focused, approach is far more practical in a clini -
cal setting.

For example, advising a patient to adopt healthful foods (e.g., olive oil), rather than the
foods individual components (monounsaturated fatty acids) is far more pragmatic when facilitating
dietary change.9
A number of dietary patterns and their relationship to cardiovascular health have been inves -
tigated including traditional diets such as those of Mediterranean and Japanese cultures, or even
the combination of those two (MediterrAsian), as well as “prudent” or healthy dietary patterns
and “western” or unhealthy dietary patterns.

Although the characteristics and definitions of these
dietary patterns vary, there are shared commonalities.

In general, diets that feature plant-based
foods (nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices), fish, seafood, and
vegetables oils, in particular, olive oil, are associated with a low risk of chronic disease while west -
ern dietary patterns featuring high amounts of red and processed meats, refined carbohydrates such
as sugars, sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, sweets, refined cereals, and solid fats are associated
with increased disease risk.10
The relationship between dietary patterns and biomarkers for CVD risk may be more meaning -
ful than those of individual nutrients or foods, which can fail to capture the effects of food synergy.11
Both prudent and western dietary patterns have been associated with several cardiovascular risk
factors; body weight, fat mass, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, systolic blood pres -
sure, diastolic blood pressure, plasma insulin, homocysteine, total cholesterol, high-density lipo -
protein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein
(CRP).12–15
There is also clear evidence to show that dietary patterns are associated with morbidity and
mortality from CVD.

Healthful dietary patterns have been associated with lower risk of myo -
cardial infarction, stroke, atherosclerosis, and death from CVD.16–19 In an illustrative prospec -
tive study, it was demonstrated that high adherence to a prudent dietary pattern was a strong
predictor of cardiovascular death in women previously free of CVD.20 Over an 18-year period,
greater adherence to the prudent pattern was associated with a 28% lower risk of cardiovascular
mortality while those with high adherence to a western dietary pattern had a 22% increase in
fatal CVD.

Two dietary patterns that have been extensively studied in observational and prospective studies,
as well as randomized controlled trials for associations with CVD, are the Mediterranean diet and
the DASH diet.

MEDITERRANEAN DIET
The traditional Mediterranean diet first attracted interest when it was noticed that the dietary pat -
tern of people living on the Greek island of Crete was associated with a greatly reduced risk of
CVD.21 Since this early observation, a vast body of literature has been accumulated and the tradi -
tional Mediterranean diet has emerged as the most likely dietary model for robust cardiovascular
benefits.22
There is, of course, no standardized diet across the diverse cultures that surround the Medi-
terranean, and the traditional foods and eating practices of the poor and rural groups upon which 106 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
the dietary pattern is based are being progressively replaced by the modernization and globalization
of food production and culture.

However, the essence and heritage of the traditional Mediterranean
diet has been captured and the current definition of the traditional Mediterranean diet is broadly a
dietary pattern that is “rich in plant foods (cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, tree nuts, seeds, and
olives), with olive oil as the principal source of added fat, along with high to moderate intakes of fish
and seafood; moderate consumption of eggs, poultry, and dairy products (cheese and yogurt); low
consumption of red meat; and a moderate intake of alcohol (mainly wine during meals).”23
The Mediterranean diet pyramid was developed and published by Mediterranean Diet Foundation
Expert Group to represent the diet and its wider lifestyle, social and environmental context (see
Figure 6.1).23
Several observational studies have demonstrated striking cardiovascular benefits of the
Mediterranean diet.

A meta-analysis and review of prospective cohort studies found that each two-
unit increment in the Mediterranean diet score was associated with a 10% lower incidence of non -
fatal and fatal CVD.24 In a more recent prospective cohort study in a multiethnic North American
population, it was found that closer adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was protective
against ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death.25 In a large Dutch cohort, higher
adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was associated with a 56% lower incidence of fatal
CVD compared to lower adherence over a mean 11.8-year period.26
Controlled intervention trials have examined the effects of the Mediterranean diet on cardiovas -
cular risk markers.

The Mediterranean diet pyramid.107 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
endpoints.

A primary prevention study in a large, high-risk cohort found that a Mediterranean diet
supplemented with walnuts or olive oil resulted in an approximately 30% reduction in major cardio -
vascular events, which was a combination of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovas -
cular causes, compared to a standard low-fat diet.28 For the secondary prevention of CVD (after first
myocardial infarction), the Lyon Diet Heart Study contrasted the effects of a Mediterranean style
diet supplemented with α-linolenic acid against a prudent western diet.

Compared to the control, the
Mediterranean style diet was associated with a 76% lower risk of cardiac death and nonfatal myo -
cardial infarction, and the protective effects were maintained for up to 4 years.29,30
DASH DIETARY PATTERN
While the Mediterranean diet had its origins in cultural history, the DASH dietary pattern was
initially conceived in the early 1990s as a rational, evidence-based dietary prescription for reducing
hypertension.31 Taking into account that at the time of its development individual nutrients were
primarily being studied, the DASH represented a tipping point in conventional nutritional wisdom.

Rather than focusing on isolated foods or nutrients, the DASH was developed as complex, synergis -
tic, dietary pattern.32
The DASH diet emphasizes fruit, vegetables, whole grains, beans, and low-fat dairy products while
including poultry, fish, seeds and nuts, and limiting red meat, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages.

Although the practical prescription focuses on foods, the diet was developed to minimize the intake
of salt, added sugars, saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol while optimizing the intake of potas -
sium, magnesium, and calcium; protein; and fiber.33 Importantly, the first DASH diet (DASH 1) had a
sodium content of about 3100 mg/day,34 whereas the follow-up study diet (DASH 2) restricted sodium
to 1500 mg daily and was able to demonstrate significantly greater reductions in blood pressure.35
Controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of the DASH diet for blood pressure reduc -
tion have found it to be at least as effective as antihypertensive medication.34–36 Beyond blood pres -
sure reduction, the DASH diet has been suggested to impact wider cardiovascular health.

Using the
Framingham risk equations to calculate 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) from
the original DASH trial, it was estimated that the intervention would reduce disease risk by 11%.37
Prospective cohort studies have shown that closer adherence to a DASH dietary pattern may
lower the incidence of CVD.

In the Nurses Health Study, adherence to the DASH dietary pattern
was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke.

Incidence of CHD was 14% lower in those
with the highest compared to the lowest adherence.38 Similarly, in a large cohort of Swedish men,
adherence to a DASH dietary pattern was associated with a 22% lower rate of heart failure events
compared to low adherence.39 In hypertensive adults in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, adherence to a DASH diet was associated with lower all-cause mortality,
including stroke.40 These apparent benefits, however, have not been confirmed in all studies with
some reports finding no or weak associations between the DASH diet and hypertension, CVD, or
cardiovascular mortality.41,42
The DASH diet has been shown to favorably affect cardiovascular risk factors.

In a dietary inter -
vention study, the DASH resulted not only in blood pressure reduction but also in improvements in
vascular and autonomic function (pulse wave velocity, baroreflex sensitivity) and reduction in left
ventricular mass.43 The diet has been shown to lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol; how -
ever, it also reduced HDL cholesterol and had no significant effects on triglycerides.44 Reductions
in homocysteine and inflammatory markers (CRP and interleukin-6) have been demonstrated.38,45
Gene–diet interactions may modify response to the DASH dietary intervention.

Carriers of the  A
allele of the β 2-adrenergic receptor have a greater blood pressure–lowering response to the DASH
diet, whereas those with the GG genotype had no significant effect.4,46 Genotype of the β 2- adrenergic
receptor has been shown to influence dietary sodium sensitivity.47 Additionally, the low sodium
DASH diet has been observed to lower oxidative stress in salt-sensitive individuals, but not in salt-
resistant hypertensive patients suggesting further gene–diet interactions.48108 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
EMERGING DIETARY CONCEPTS IN CARDIOVASCULAR NUTRITION
Promoting an individualized, complex diet and dietary behaviors that center on healthful foods
is fundamental to clinical nutrition; however, our relationship with food is more complex and the
construction of a heart-healthy diet may extend beyond simply eating the right food.

A number of
emerging concepts in clinical nutrition are proving to be very important for optimizing cardiovas -
cular health, and these move beyond recommending a healthful dietary pattern.

How much we eat
(caloric restriction), how we prepare it (minimizing exposure to high-heat cooking by-products),
and how alkaline it is (the influence on acid–alkaline balance) are examples of important areas that
deserve clinical consideration.

caloric  restriction
Caloric restriction in the context of human clinical nutrition refers to the reduction of energy intake
to an individualized level that is sufficient to maintain a slightly low to normal body weight (i.e.,
BMI < 21 kg/m2) without causing malnutrition (i.e., adequate intake of proteins and micronutri -
ents).49 In this context, long-term calorie restriction has been extensively studied in animal models
and shown to be one of the most potent interventions for improving metabolic health, offsetting
chronic disease and consequently extending life span.50
A number of cardiovascular benefits of caloric restriction have been identified in animal studies
including reductions in oxidative stress and inflammation in the vasculature and heart, beneficial
effects on endothelial function and arterial stiffness, protection against atherosclerosis, and attenu -
ation of age-related changes in the heart (e.g., reduction in myocardial fibrosis and preservation or
improvement in left ventricular diastolic function).51 Although much of this research is limited to
animal studies, there is telling evidence from human data that suggests some of these effects trans -
late to human caloric restriction as well.52
An exemplary diet for caloric restriction is that of the people of the Japanese island of
Okinawa, who are one of the few populations in the world who have experienced mild, long-
term caloric restriction in a natural setting without malnutrition.

The Okinawans are also unique
in that they have an unusually low incidence of chronic diseases including CVD (18 deaths per
100,000 inhabitants per year compared to 100 in the United States) and are among the longest-
lived people in the world (an average of 83.8 years compared to 78.9 years in the United States).53
These differences in disease incidence and life span are thought to be at least in part due to diet.

Analysis of the traditional Okinawan diet has revealed that Okinawans were in a negative energy
balance of approximately 11% until the 1960s (before progressive westernization of their diet).54
Notably, the traditional Okinawan diet shares many general features of the Mediterranean and
DASH diets, however, it also characteristically includes a high consumption of green leafy veg -
etables, sweet potato, soy foods, seaweeds, herbs and spices and low consumption of dairy products
and daily green tea.55
Sustained calorie restriction has also been studied in a controlled clinical trial and in people
practicing voluntary caloric restriction.

These preliminary and observational human studies suggest
that caloric restriction may improve a number of cardiovascular risk factors including body weight,
visceral adipose tissue, inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and
insulin, insulin sensitivity, cholesterol, and left ventricular diastolic function.56
Alternate-day fasting (ADF) or intermittent fasting is an approach that is gaining popularity and
has experimental and clinical evidence to support its use.

Typically, ADF involves consuming 25%
of energy needs on the fast day and ad libitum food intake on the following day.57 This regimen
has been shown to significantly influence weight loss and cardiometabolic health with reductions
in aortic vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, CRP, adiponectin, leptin, total cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, triacylglycerol concentrations and systolic blood pressure, and increases in LDL par -
ticle size in a relatively short period.58–60109 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
Caloric restriction could be practically achieved by constructing a personalized diet based on
nutrient-dense, low-energy foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, fish, low-fat dairy
products, and lean meats and coaching in concepts such as volumetrics and low-glycemic index (GI)
foods, as well as ensuring adequate protein and fiber at meals to improve satiety and adherence.61
ADVANCED GLYCATION END PRODUCTS (AGE s)
Modern dietary changes with importance for cardiovascular health include how we cook and pre -
pare food.

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a group of oxidant, inflammatory com -
pounds with significance in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases including CVD.

AGEs are formed
during a reaction between reducing sugars and free amino groups of proteins, lipids, or nucleic
acids known as the Maillard reaction, which occurs during normal metabolism.

In addition to AGEs
produced during metabolism, diet is known to be a significant contributor to the endogenous AGE
pool.

Cooking methods associated with modern diets, including industrial heat processing, grilling,
broiling, roasting, searing, and frying, significantly increase dietary AGE formation and exposure.62
Experimental research indicates that a low AGE diet may decrease circulating AGE levels, lower
inflammatory mediators, and reduce atherosclerosis development.63 In humans, a single high AGE
meal has been shown to impair postprandial endothelial function.64 Intervention with diet based
on high AGE foods for 1 month was shown to influence a number of biomarkers relevant to car -
diovascular risk (insulin sensitivity, plasma concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins C and
E, cholesterol, and triglycerides) in a group of healthy individuals.65 A subsequent 6-week human
intervention study with a low AGE diet in diabetic patients demonstrated a marked reduction in
inflammation and oxidative stress compared to a standard diet.66
From a clinical perspective, dietary intake of AGEs can be reduced by two general means.

First,
avoiding foods that are known to be high in AGEs, including full-fat cheeses, meats, and highly
processed foods, while increasing the consumption of fish, grains, low-fat milk products, fruits, and
vegetables.

Second, adopting traditional cooking methods such as boiling, poaching, and stewing, as
well as steaming and slower cooking at a lower heat can markedly reduce dietary AGE exposure.67
DIETARY ACID LOAD
Diet-induced “low-grade” metabolic acidosis has been proposed to play an important role in the
development of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases.

An underlying basis for diet-induced
low-grade metabolic acidosis is the notion that divergence from our ancestral diet, which would
have featured predominantly in wild plant foods, toward cereal grains, dairy products, and a higher
intake of meats with the agricultural revolution some 10,000 years ago, and more recently to a
highly industrialized diet has resulted in a relative deficiency of potassium alkali salts and subse -
quent increase in net systemic dietary acid load.68
In general, vegetables, fruits, and alkali-rich beverages (red wine and coffee) are alkaline,
whereas fats and oils are neutral, and meats, dairy products, and cereal grains are acid producing.69
Accordingly, a large population study showed that a diet higher in fruits and vegetables and lower
in meats was strongly associated with a more alkaline physiological state.70
There is some evidence to suggest that a higher dietary acid load may be associated with CVD
risk factors including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total and LDL cholesterol, BMI, and
waist circumference.71 Dietary acid load has been associated with risk of hypertension in some,
but not all studies.72,73 Furthermore, diet-induced acidosis may contribute to insulin resistance and
subsequent CVD risk.74
From a clinical standpoint, dietary acid load can be reduced by increasing the intake of fruits
and vegetables and decreasing excessively high dietary protein intake.75 Dietary intervention stud -
ies are currently lacking, although one study found an alkaline diet effectively reduced urinary uric
acid levels.76 A short-term (10-day) intervention with a highly alkaline “paleolithic diet” resulted 110 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
in a marked increase in potassium intake and improvements in vascular reactivity, blood pressure,
glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and lipid profiles.77 Although the clinical effects of modifica -
tion of dietary acid load on cardiovascular health are not yet clear, such dietary changes are in line
with recommendations such as the Mediterranean style diet.

MACRONUTRIENTS
The difficulty in the discernment of the effect of specific macronutrients on cardiovascular function
is that the overall dietary pattern consists of complex varieties of foods containing compounds other
than macronutrients, which may impact the physiological effect of the food.8 After all, macronutri -
ents are not eaten in isolation, but are constituents as part of the larger whole pattern of eating.

With
this point taken under consideration, trends in foods that predominate in certain macronutrients and
their relationship to CVD risk will be discussed.

PROTEIN
Proteins in the body serve a multitude of functions including acting as structural components,
enzyme constituents, nutrient carriers, fluid balance regulators, and signaling molecules, to name
a few.

Thus, it would seem that dietary protein, and ensuring intake of the essential amino acids
that cannot be made endogenously, is an important constituent to consider for cardiac structure and
function.

One example of a well-established role of dietary protein is the presence of key peptides,
which serve as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) compounds.

In some cases, the research may indicate that what the dietary protein may be replacing in the
diet is more or less important than the mere inclusion of protein in the diet itself.

Additionally, what
has not been adequately explored in many studies investigating the impact of dietary protein on car -
diovascular issues is the source, quality, and exact composition of the protein (e.g., Is the meat from
a cow that has been grass-fed or corn-fed?)

along with how individual subsets of the population and
corresponding genotypes may respond differently to various types of protein.

along with how individual subsets of the population and
corresponding genotypes may respond differently to various types of protein.

Therefore, with the
best data currently available, this chapter will focus on the role of vegetable versus animal protein,
soy, whey, and fish and their associations with CVD.

VEGETABLE VERSUS ANIMAL PROTEIN
cHd r isK Factors
Compelling research on the divergent effects of dietary animal versus vegetable protein on risk of
CHD comes from the Nurses’ Health Study data collection and subsequent lineage of publications.

An early study by Hu et al.78 on this large cohort of over 80,000 women for a duration of 14 years
indicated that there was a positive association between the consumption of red meat and high-fat
dairy products and the risk of CHD, whereas poultry, fish, and low-fat dairy intake were associated
with a decreased risk.

Further work on this same cohort was undertaken by Halton et al.9 in which
they indirectly investigated the association between dietary protein and CHD by primarily examin -
ing the effects of whether a low-carbohydrate diet influences CHD risk over 20 years of follow-up.

Although they found that low-carbohydrate diets with compensatory increases in protein and fat
were not associated with increased CHD, they did find that vegetable sources of protein (and fat)
reduced the risk of CHD.

Similar findings were observed in the prospective follow-up of the women
in the Nurses’ Health Study over a longer period of 26 years: higher intakes of red meat and  high-fat
dairy were significantly associated with greater risk of CHD, whereas consumption of poultry, fish,
and nuts was associated with a lower risk.

In comparison with one serving of red meat daily, 30%,
24%, 19%, and 13% lower risks of CHD were seen with one serving/day of nuts, fish, poultry, and
low-fat dairy, respectively.

A meta-analysis by Maki et al.80 showed no significant differences in 111 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol) in healthy individuals when comparing
lean beef with either poultry or fish consumption.

Thus, when it comes to CHD risk factors, the
overall consensus from this large, prospective cohort of women over decades of observation is that
vegetable protein appears to be somewhat more protective than animal protein; however, since the
consumption of plant foods may be a marker of a healthy lifestyle, it is worthwhile to evaluate these
findings in further trials.

HyPertension
A number of observational studies have investigated the association between animal and plant
protein and blood pressure, resulting in inconclusive results but indicating a general trend toward
greater benefit with plant protein.81–86 Further, in a meta-analysis to determine the effect of dietary
protein consumption with blood pressure, Rebholz et al.87 concluded from the 40 selected trials and
over 3200 subjects that depending on the dietary variables being compared there were different
findings on the role of protein.

When compared to dietary carbohydrate, there was a statistically
significant reduction in both mean systolic ( −1.76 mmHg) and diastolic ( −1.15 mmHg) blood pres -
sure, and, in contrast to the data on CHD, there was no distinct difference between vegetable and
animal protein and their blood pressure–lowering effects.

In line with these findings relative to the
difference between dietary carbohydrate and protein, He et al.88 conducted a randomized, double-
blind crossover trial to determine the effect of soy protein, milk protein, or carbohydrate (a mixture
of sucrose, fructose, and maltodextrin with a GI of 98.9) supplementation on blood pressure in
adults with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension.

Compared with the carbohydrate supplement,
soy protein and milk protein both significantly lowered blood pressure, with no significant differ -
ence between the two.

Compared with the carbohydrate supplement,
soy protein and milk protein both significantly lowered blood pressure, with no significant differ -
ence between the two.

Thus, the overall clinical application of these collective findings may involve
replacing dietary (high glycemic index) carbohydrate with protein when there are concerns about
hypertension.

In a larger study with over 20,000 Dutch adults, proteins from a variety of different sources were
investigated for their effects on blood pressure, including the intakes of total, plant, animal, dairy,
meat, and grain protein.89 Although the effects of total protein and meat protein appeared to be
insignificant, there was a protective effect of plant protein, which was most pronounced in subjects
with untreated hypertensive, quite possibly a more sensitive subset of the population and consistent
with the OmniHeart study findings.90 When the researchers looked more specifically at the types of
plant protein that might be responsible for this effect, they found vegetable protein (and not protein
intake from potatoes, legumes, and fruits) to have a small inverse relationship with blood pressure.

Therefore, vegetables may be an indicator of a healthy lifestyle and have other attributes such as
decreased net dietary acid load, which could further make them desirable dietary components for
blood pressure reduction.

On the basis of the science available to suggest that there is an inverse relationship between
dietary (vegetable) protein and hypertension, Altorf-van der Kuil et al.91 examined whether certain
amino acids, including glutamic acid, arginine, cysteine, lysine, or tyrosine, could be attributed to
this association in a Dutch population over 6 years of follow-up.

Although there was a statistically
significant reduction in systolic blood pressure ( −2.4 mmHg) with a higher intake of tyrosine (at
~0.3% of protein), the authors concluded that there was not a major role for any of these amino acids
in the prediction of occurrence or risk of hypertension in this Dutch cohort.

In another study inves -
tigating a smaller number of subjects who had prevalent CVD over a shorter duration of just 2 years,
who were following one of two dietary patterns, it was noted that intakes of methionine and alanine
were positively associated with higher blood pressure, whereas threonine and histidine had inverse
associations.92 An in vivo study conducted in 2007 measured the ACEI activity of peptides gener -
ated through milk fermentation using the lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactic  and Lactobacillus
helveticus  and found foods containing ACEI peptides beneficial in lowering blood pressure.93 In
2010, studies confirmed the potent hypotensive qualities of tripeptides valine, proline, proline and 112 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
isoleucine, proline, proline extracted from Lactobacillus helveticus  casein fermentations.94 On the
basis of these studies, it would seem that further delineation of specific amino acids and their effect
on blood pressure in population groups is warranted.

stroKe
In a large, prospective study of 34,670 Swedish women without CVD over 10.4 years of follow-up,
Larsson et al.95 demonstrated a significant inverse association between total and animal protein and
stroke events, especially for women with a history of hypertension.

Similar findings were docu -
mented by Bernstein et al.96 in a prospective study with 84,010 American women and 43,150 men
without CVD after more than two decades of follow-up, respectively: greater consumption of red
meat was associated with increased incidence of stroke, whereas poultry intake was associated with
a lower risk.

Substituting poultry, nuts, fish, and low-fat dairy for red meat led to 27%, 17%, 17%,
and 11% reductions in risk for stroke, respectively, and there was no association with exchanging red
meat for legumes or eggs.

On the contrary, Preis et al.97 did not find a statistically significant effect
for increased risk of stroke for total and animal protein and decreased risk of stroke with vegetable
protein in a large, prospective study with 43,960 Japanese men free of CVD followed over 18 years.

The conflicting findings among the literature, may, in part, be due to the different protein sources
and even genotypic responses to these proteins in the respective countries.

soy Protein
A meta-analysis by Anderson and Bush98 assessed clinical trials related to soy protein intake and
serum lipoprotein changes and found that soy protein intake at 15–30 g daily had favorable impacts on
LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with non-soy controls.

Furthermore,
data exist to indicate that soy protein reduces LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol when
specifically compared with milk protein.99 Despite the number of studies indicating a positive effect
of soy protein in the diet for cardiovascular markers, there has been debate about the inclusion of soy
protein in the diet and whether the health claim on soy protein and heart health should be reconsid -
ered.100,101 One explanation for the variable effects of soy protein on cardiovascular parameters may
be related to differences in population subgroups.

For example, Hodis et al.102 demonstrated that a soy
protein/isoflavone supplement had no effect on atherosclerotic progression in postmenopausal women,
but a favorable effect for healthy, premenopausal women.

Furthermore, the variability in studies on
soy may also be due to the heterogeneity of available soy products and their degree of processing,
resulting in a variety of by-products formed.

Tomatsu et al.103 reported on novel ACEI peptides that
could be derived from soy that are comparable with those peptides derived from other sources.

Finally, more recent studies have begun to explore the potential mechanisms for soy protein on
cardiovascular markers.

In a three-phase crossover trial in adults with 40 g of soy protein, 40 g of
milk protein, and 40 g of complex carbohydrate, Rebholz et al.104 found improvements in E-selectin
compared with milk protein.

Conversely, in individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hyperten -
sion, no effect on cell adhesion molecules was found after 8 weeks of either a whole soy bean, soy
protein isolate, or cow’s milk beverage.105
wHey Protein
A number of studies demonstrate that chronic intake of several grams (typically 20 g) of whey
protein has clinically significant blood pressure–lowering effects.106–109 Additionally, whey protein
reduces elevated triglycerides and cholesterol levels and even inflammation in patients with CVD
and cerebrovascular disease.107,110,111 There is some evidence that these benefits from whey protein
may come from chronic consumption rather than an acute meal.

Pal and Ellis112 studied the acute
meal effects of 45 g whey protein isolate compared with either the same amount of sodium caseinate 113 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
or a glucose control in a randomized, three-way crossover design study with 20 overweight and
obese postmenopausal women.

They did not find any significant postprandial differences between
the groups for vascular, inflammatory, or blood pressure changes.

The type of whey protein formulation may significantly impact results.

For example, data from
clinical trials indicate that whey protein must be hydrolyzed to ACEI peptides for it to have antihy -
pertensive properties.106–108,113,114 When proteins are broken down into individual peptides, some of
these peptides can be used to act as inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, a protein that is
responsible for blood pressure regulation.

Furthermore, it is worthwhile to note that certain whey
protein preparations may result in a relatively higher insulin response relative to other protein
sources, which may or may not be beneficial in some patient populations.115,116
Finally, there may also be food interactions that may enhance or potentiate the ACEI activity of
peptides within whey protein.

Murakami et al.117 found that simultaneous consumption of tea with
whey protein may reduce the blood pressure–lowering efficacy of the protein.

Conversely, there may be
particular whey formulations that lead to better results.

A recent study by Petyaev et al.118 demonstrated
that when whey protein isolate was embedded into lycopene micelles and fed to patients with hyperten -
sion over 1 month, there were several favorable changes in cardiovascular function, plasma lipids, and
inflammatory markers, compared with simple formulations of either the whey protein or the lycopene.

Overall, studies support fish consumption for cardiovascular health.119 Mozaffarian and Rimm120
found evidence to support that even modest consumption of fish at 1 to 2 servings weekly,
especially higher omega-3 fatty acid-containing fish, reduces risk of coronary death by 36% and
total mortality by 17%.

They also advised consuming a variety of seafood with limited intake of
high  mercury-containing fish with greater fish consumption ( ≥5 servings/week).

Two recent meta-
analysis findings confirmed positive results for fish consumption: Li et al.121 demonstrated that fish
consumption is protective for heart failure with every increment of 20 g of daily fish intake associ -
ated with a 6% lower risk of this condition, whereas Chowdhury et al.122 identified a similar, yet
moderate, inverse association between fish consumption and cerebrovascular risk.

Of note, there
may be gender specific differences to the response of fish consumption.

In a large prospective trial
with 20,069 men and women followed over 8–13 years, de Goede et al.123 found that increased fish
intakes were associated with reduced stroke incidence in women while that same association could
not be found in men.

Moreover, there may be physiological differences from intakes of the differ -
ent fish protein sources.

Pilon et al.124 compared metabolic effects of bonito, herring, mackerel, or
salmon against casein in high-fat-, high-sucrose-fed rats and reported that all the fish proteins were
superior to casein in reducing inflammatory markers; however, the salmon protein resulted in some
differences in calcitonin levels compared with the other fish proteins.

There are actives within fish that add to its cardioprotective qualities.

Studies have documented
the presence of ACEI in fish such as bonito and sardines.125–127 Oral consumption of sardine muscle
protein, which contains valyl–tyrosine (Val–Tyr), by mildly hypertensive volunteers led to 9.7 and
5.3 mmHg reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, within just 1 week.128
The science to support the role of omega-3 fatty acids from fish in CVD will be addressed in the
section “Fats and Oils.”
In evaluating studies on fish consumption, it is important to consider that there could be con -
founding variables related to those who choose to eat fish such as other positive, healthful lifestyle
factors as well as genetic factors.129,130 In a study by Sofi et al.130 in 647 Italian men, it was demon -
strated that there was a significant gene–dietary interaction with one of the polymorphisms for the
lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] gene (LPA 93C>T polymorphism) and fish intake, resulting in reduced Lp(a)
concentrations with daily fish intake.

What is often not taken into consideration is the type of fish and its methylmercury levels, and
further, the degree to which individuals can metabolize mercury based on polymorphisms they 114 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
may have for the metallothionein protein131 or glutathione-related genes.132 Methylmercury has
detrimental effects on cardiovascular health in certain populations, including increasing heart
rate,133 blood pressure,134,135 and incidence of myocardial infarction136; however, ultimately, it has
been suggested that the benefits of fish eating outweigh the risks from the potential toxins it
contains.120
Fats and oils
Of all the macronutrients, dietary fats and oils have most likely received the most attention in
the field of cardiovascular nutrition with the greatest degree of studies, including controlled feed -
ing studies, randomized trials, and large cohort studies.

As Willett137 has suggested, the total fat
amount may not be as important as the type of diet.

If not oxidized for energy, dietary fatty acids
may become cellular structural and functional components that may have far-reaching impacts on
CVD processes such as inflammation.

Essential fatty acids such as those from the omega-6 and
omega-3 families must be consumed from food in proper quantities relative to other ingested fats to
impact the regulation of inflammation through the production of eicosanoid-derived prostaglandins.

Within this section, the individual fatty acid families will be discussed along with significant stud -
ies to demonstrate their role in CVD.

Trans Fats (TFAs)
TFAs can be found in nature and may be produced industrially.

Vaccenic acid and the naturally
occurring isomer of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), cis-9, trans-11 CLA (c9, t11-CLA), are found in
meat and milk products derived from ruminant animals.138 Other TFAs may form in the industrial
production of solid fats from liquid oils through the process of partial hydrogenation,139 in addition
to small amounts produced in the course of the deodorization and refinement of vegetable oils.140
It is well established that the industrially produced TFAs (iTFAs), ubiquitous in the processed food
supply, are detrimental to cardiovascular health due to their ability to impair endothelial function,
elevate triglycerides and Lp(a) lipoprotein, increase thrombogenesis, reduce the particle size of LDL
cholesterol, and increase LDL cholesterol while simultaneously decreasing HDL cholesterol.141–144
Specifically, one meta-analysis found that a 2% increase in energy intake from TFAs was associated
with a 23% increase in the incidence of CHD.145 The presence of iTFAs in the systemic circulation
favors inflammation, ultimately contributing to atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart hypertro -
phy as well as other chronic diseases.146,147 It has been proposed by Angelieri et al.148 that TFA
contributes to inflammation and metabolic disturbances by altering cell signaling via intracellular
kinases and insulin receptor substrates.

From a nutrigenomic perspective, an animal study by Collison et al.149 demonstrated that an
iTFA-containing diet induced over twice as many cardiac differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
in males compared to females, including downregulation of Gata4 , Mef2d , and Srebf2 .

This type
of nutrigenomic research needs to be evaluated in human clinical trials as this information would
be invaluable for making dietary recommendations and improving patient compliance to eating
regimens.

The limited studies that are available examining the effect of naturally occurring TFAs from
ruminants indicate inconclusive results.

The limited studies that are available examining the effect of naturally occurring TFAs from
ruminants indicate inconclusive results.

Ganguly and Pierce150 stated that there may be cardiopro -
tective effects while a comprehensive review of studies by Gebauer et al.151 led to the conclusion
that more research is required to have a better understanding of the cardiovascular and general -
ized health effects of these ruminant TFAs, especially at levels normally found in the diet.

Along
similar lines, Smit et al.152 demonstrated that when 61 healthy adults were fed diets containing
7% of energy from either oleic acid (18:1n-9, control diet), iTFAs, or CLA, inflammatory mark -
ers remained unaffected and urinary concentrations of 8-iso-PGF(2 α) increased in the group fed
CLA.

Additional research is warranted to fully understand the effects of ruminant TFAs and their
mechanisms of action.115 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
Saturated Fats
From early work by Ancel Keys several decades ago, dietary saturated fats as a collective macronu -
trient category has been associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular events.

This research
had, in part, set the foundation for public health recommendations to restrict saturated fat consump -
tion to reduce CVD risk due to its influence on increasing LDL cholesterol; however, it is well
accepted that saturated fat also increases HDL cholesterol.

Thus, it would seem that saturated fat
would not significantly alter an important CVD risk marker, the total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol
ratio.153 This effect is differentially modulated by the individual saturated fatty acids when replac -
ing dietary carbohydrate with stearic acid (18:0) having no effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol and
with lauric acid (12:0) having the greatest effect on increasing both LDL and HDL cholesterol.154
Therefore, the public health guidance to lower dietary saturated fat is under scrutiny and the aspect
of the type of saturated fat is being more thoroughly investigated due to the lack of a strong associa -
tion in prospective studies.

Newer studies continue to be contradictory and inconclusive.155 Cooper et al.156 reviewed several
studies and found that reducing saturated fat by reducing and/or modifying dietary fat resulted in
a 14% reduced risk in cardiovascular events.

In contrast, Siri-Tarino et al.157 assessed the evidence
related to dietary saturated fat intake with risk of CHD, stroke, and CVD in 21 prospective epidemi -
ologic studies which included 347,747 subjects over 5–23 years of follow-up.

The findings revealed
that there was no significant relationship between dietary saturated fat intake and increased risk
of CHD or CVD.

The authors suggested that more research is required to ascertain the effects of
nutrients that are used to replace the saturated fat.

Along these lines, de Oliveira Otto et al.158 investigated whether there was variability in the food
source of saturated fat in relationship to CVD events and reported that a higher intake of dairy satu -
rated fat was associated with a lower CVD risk, whereas a higher intake of meat saturated fat was
associated with greater CVD risk.

Substituting 2% of energy from meat saturated fat with energy
from dairy saturated fat resulted in a 25% lower CVD risk.

There was no association observed
between plant or butter saturated fat, but the data were limited by the narrow range of intake.

Furthermore, there are differential effects even within the dairy category of foods with cheeses hav -
ing smaller effects on LDL cholesterol concentrations compared with butter and fermented dairy
foods, such as yogurt and even certain probiotic microorganisms, being associated with reductions
in LDL cholesterol.

Hence, it may be that there are other constituents in foods that have effects on
CVD risk, which are worthwhile to evaluate.

Hence, it may be that there are other constituents in foods that have effects on
CVD risk, which are worthwhile to evaluate.

It is important to assess the total food source of satu -
rated fat when tailoring individual dietary recommendations.

Additionally, gene–diet interactions may be involved in an individual’s response to dietary satu -
rated fat.154 An example of this nutrigenomic interaction was evident in a study159 that investigated
polymorphisms in the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR) gene and dietary intake.

The researchers observed that a certain polymorphism (PPAR α V162) was associated with smaller
peak particle diameters of LDL cholesterol in subjects with higher saturated fat intakes compared
with those with lower intakes.

Another study160 identified an association between endothelial nitric
oxide synthase (eNOS) gene variations and effects of an acute, high saturated fat meal in young,
healthy men.

Finally, an interaction between the apoE-4 allele and a greater LDL response to satu -
rated fat has been reported in some studies.154
Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFAs): Omega-3 and Omega-6 Fatty Acids
The beneficial effect of dietary inclusion of PUFAs has been demonstrated in a number of stud -
ies161 with one of the meta-analyses162 indicating that a 5% increase in energy from PUFAs led to
a 10% reduction in risk for CVD.

Other studies163,164 have shown that substitution of saturated fat
with PUFAs results in decreased total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, with a greater reduction in LDL
cholesterol compared with HDL cholesterol.

Moreover, Willett137 states that replacing saturated fat
with PUFAs leads to the best result when compared with monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) and car -
bohydrate (depending on the type of carbohydrate).116 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
The two main essential PUFA families are the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, which are
found in vegetable oils and nuts (omega-6 and the shorter chain omega-3) and fish (the longer chain
omega-3).

Although the ratio of these two important fatty acid families has been the focus of nutri -
tion recommendations, with a focus on increasing omega-3 and limiting omega-6 fatty acids, espe -
cially linoleic acid (18:2n-6), due to their potential proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects.

However, there is some controversy regarding this assumption about omega-6 fatty acids.

A human
clinical trial by Pischon et al.165 demonstrated that the greatest degree of anti-inflammatory effects
were observed with the combination of both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in the diet.

Further,
Anton et al.161 clarify that part of the controversy surrounding linoleic acid could come from a lack
of studies distinguishing between naturally occurring linoleic acid such as from sunflower oil and
chemically hydrogenated forms of this fatty acid, such as is seen with hydrogenated vegetable oil
and TFAs overall.

It has been suggested that since both of the PUFA families are essential and important for CVD
risk reduction, it would be better to not solely focus on the omega-6:omega-3 ratio but on the whole
foods that will provide the desirable mixture of fatty acids and have been shown to be beneficial
for reducing CVD incidence.137 The American Heart Association supports the concept of ensuring
healthy intakes of both omega-3 (about 500 mg/day from fish or fish oil supplements) and omega-6
fatty acids (12 g for women and 17 g for men per day) for the prevention and treatment of CVD.166
According to Lavie et al.,167 consumption of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) should
be at least 800–1000 mg/day for individuals with known CHD and heart failure.

A large, prospec -
tive study168 in 34,670 Swedish women over a mean of 10.4 years revealed an inverse relation -
ship between dietary intake of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs and risk of stroke.

A large, prospec -
tive study168 in 34,670 Swedish women over a mean of 10.4 years revealed an inverse relation -
ship between dietary intake of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs and risk of stroke.

However, there was
no association between saturated fat, mononunsaturated fat, PUFA, α-linolenic acid, and omega-6
PUFAs and risk of stroke.

Select whole foods provide the essential fatty acids include nuts, seeds, nut and seed oils, leafy
greens, algae and fish oils.

Foods high in naturally occurring omega-6 PUFAs such as nuts, and
in particular, walnuts, have been shown to be cardioprotective.169,170 The different components
of flaxseed, such as the α-linolenic acid-rich oil and the lignans, may each have cardioprotective
effects.

Fukumitsu et al.171 found that 100 mg of the flaxseed lignan (secoisolariciresinol diglu -
coside) was effective at reducing blood cholesterol and hepatic enzymes in moderately hyper -
cholesterolemic men.

Both flaxseed oil and fish oil supplementation have been shown to increase
longer chain omega-3 fatty acids in red blood cell membranes,172 and flaxseed oil incorporation
into the diet at 8 g/day for 12 weeks resulted in reduced blood pressure in dyslipidemic subjects
compared to a high linoleic acid diet.173 Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation may be useful for
primary prevention of CVD167; however, a recent large meta-analysis174 indicated that there was
no demonstrable effect for secondary prevention, a finding which is quite opposed to conclusions
from previous studies.167
A number of nutrigenomic studies have elucidated interactions between the omega-3 fatty acids
and gene expression in relationship to molecular events at all stages of atherogenesis, specifically
decreasing activation of the host of nuclear factor-kappa B transcription factors.175 Schmidt et al.176
investigated the effects of omega-3 PUFAs supplementation versus that of corn oil on genomic
expression in healthy and dyslipidemic subjects after 4 hours, 1 week, and 12 weeks.

Findings
revealed that 12-week supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs led to downregulation in proinflam -
matory genes.

In a separate publication, Schmidt et al.177 identified that 1.56 g EPA and 1.14 g
DHA for 12 weeks to healthy and dyslipidemic men resulted in increased expression of antioxidant
enzymes and decreased expression of pro-oxidant enzymes, suggesting further protective effects
of these long-chain PUFAs.

Finally, Liang et al.178 suggest that the variable results of long-chain
omega-3 PUFAs on CVD biomarkers such as lipids may be due to interactions between the APOE
genotype and the fatty acid.

Personalized recommendations for dietary intake and supplementation
may be warranted based on these preliminary findings.

More research is required to examine the
effects of omega-3 PUFA intake in different genotype groupings.117 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
Monounsaturated Fats
The benefit of MUFAs in the diet, particularly oleic acid through consumption of olive oil, has
been consistently touted as being cardioprotective.

Data have shown that MUFAs tend to reduce
LDL cholesterol without lowering HDL cholesterol179; however, there are inconclusive results
for CVD, such as in the meta-analysis by Jakobsen et al.,180 where there was a positive correla -
tion between MUFA-containing diets and risk of coronary events, but not between MUFA-rich
diets and risk of coronary deaths.

It has been postulated that the differences in MUFA origin
may account for these differences, with most of the MUFAs in the western diet from animal
sources.

One of the main MUFA-containing foods in a healthful diet is olive oil.

One of the main MUFA-containing foods in a healthful diet is olive oil.

Previous studies on olive
oil consumption indicate it has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antithrombotic effects, particu -
larly when high in phenol content.181,182 Camargo et al.183 explored whether the positive cardioprotec -
tive benefits of olive oil were due to the oil or the phenol content and reported 98 DEGs between
phenol-rich and low-phenol olive oil, especially those related to inflammatory pathways.

Along
similar lines, individuals with a specific polymorphisms of the interleukin (IL)-6 gene (-174G/C),
the minor allele frequency (C), had lower body weight gain when following the Mediterranean diet
plus a high intake of virgin olive oil.

Despite the plethora of data accumulated to support the inclusion of olive oil and MUFAs into
the diet for cardiovascular benefit, there are some studies that indicate questionable effects of
MUFAs.184 For example, a study in African green monkeys185 fed MUFAs in place of saturated fat
resulted in greater enrichment of LDL particles with cholesteryl oleate, an indicator of atheroge -
nicity as shown in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.186,187 Further, Imamura et al.188
proposes that long-chain MUFAs (22:1 and 24:1) found in a variety of food sources, including fish,
poultry, meats, whole grains, and mustard, may be cardiotoxic due to their association with incident
congestive heart failure (CHF) in two independent cohorts.

carbo Hydrate
Due to its implication in glucose and insulin balance, carbohydrate has been a significant focus in
dietary recommendations for type 2 diabetes and CVD.

Although, much like protein and fats, the
overall quantity and quality of carbohydrate needs to be considered in dietary guidance for certain
patient populations.

Hyperglycemia is closely intertwined with cardiovascular issues such as hepatic
lipid synthesis and endothelial function, thus, glycemic control is important to consider for CVD.

Therefore, it has been suggested that low-glycemic carbohydrates or those food sources of carbohy -
drates that have negligible or moderate impact on postprandial blood glucose levels such as whole
fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are most suitable for individuals with lifestyle-induced
chronic disease such as CVD.

carbo Hydrate  quantity
A meta-analysis by Hu et al.189 investigated the effect of low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets
on metabolic risk factors in 23 trials with a total of 2788 participants.

They found that low-
carbohydrate diets led to better reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides
and an improvement in HDL cholesterol.

This study’s findings are in contrast to the meta-  analysis
from Nordmann et al.190 in which they analyzed five trials of 447 overweight subjects and demon -
strated favorable reductions in triglycerides and HDL cholesterol for the low-carbohydrate diet;
however, the low-fat diet performed better on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.

Finally, a
review and meta-analysis by Santos et al.191 in obese patients on a low-carbohydrate diet to assess
cardiovascular risk factors found that this diet resulted in significant decreases in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, plasma triglycerides, an increase in HDL cholesterol, and no significant 118 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
change in LDL cholesterol.

The subtle discrepancies in the findings of these three meta-analyses
may, in part, be due to the quality of carbohydrate consumed by the subjects.

The subtle discrepancies in the findings of these three meta-analyses
may, in part, be due to the quality of carbohydrate consumed by the subjects.

LOW GI VERSUS HIGH GI
Although the role of GI has been well studied in the context of individuals with type 2 diabetes
and metabolic syndrome, there has not been the same depth of exploration for cardiovascular
conditions; however, due to the interrelationship between these two chronic diseases, it would
seem that there would be some relevance of glycemic impact in association with cardiovascular
risk factors.

In a meta-analysis by Ma et al.,192 14 studies with 229,213 subjects were assessed
to determine the role of GI and glycemic load (GL) on CVD risk.

Both GI and GL were found
to be associated with significant increased risk of CVD with a greater risk incurred for women
compared with men.

Another meta-analysis193 that included 8 prospective studies and 220,050
subjects reported similar results with both high dietary GL and GI being associated with risk of
CHD with the most striking correlation found in women (relative risk ( RR): 1.69, 95% confidence
interval [CI]: 1.32–2.16).

One of the mechanisms of how GI and GL may be associated with CVD may through modulation
of inflammatory processes.

Studies have indicated that a low-GI diet reduces markers of inflamma -
tion such as CRP.194,195 In the FUNGENUT study, Kallio et al.196 tested two types of carbohydrate
meals varying in quality and GI, a low-GI rye pasta and a high-GI oat–wheat–potato combination
in individuals with metabolic syndrome.

They demonstrated a differential gene expression between
the meals with the oat–wheat–potato diet causing upregulation of 62 genes related to stress, immu -
nity, and inflammation after 12 weeks.

Fiber
High-fiber foods such as legumes, whole grains, vegetables, and fruits have beneficial effects on
cardiovascular function.

A number of studies have documented an inverse relationship between
fiber intake and cardiovascular risk with a stronger association for cereal fiber than fruit or  vegetable
fiber, possibly due to multiple mechanistic effects such as reduction of lipids, body weight, glucose,
blood pressure, and even inflammation.197 According to Lee et al.,198 a fiber increase of approxi -
mately 17 g/day can result in blood pressure decreases of 1.15 mmHg (systolic) and 1.65 mmHg
(diastolic).

Soluble fiber seems to lead to better results than insoluble fiber.

Thus, tailoring the fiber
source to the cardiovascular condition as a means of personalizing the approach may be indicated.

Furthermore, the effects of high-fiber foods on CVD may be due to their role in inflammation.

A
significant inverse association between several cytokines (IL-1 β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, and tumor
necrosis factor- α) and cereal fiber was noted in 88 cancer-free subjects.199 At the end of 5 weeks
of consumption of either high- or low-fiber intakes (48.0 and 30.2 g/day, respectively) from oat
bran, rye bran, and sugar beet fiber, there was a significant reduction in CRP between the two fiber
diets.200
Specific high-fiber foods have also been evaluated for their effects on cardiovascular bio -
markers; however, it is not apparent whether their effects are due to their fiber content or other
constituents such as the vast array of phytochemicals.

In some cases, there may be synergy
among the food components.

For example, Lee et al.198 commented that dietary protein com -
bined with fiber may have additive effects on lowering blood pressure.

Tighe et al.201 determined
that whole grain foods such as wheat and oats fed to middle-aged health individuals led to sig -
nificant reductions in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure (6 and 3 mmHg, respectively).

Bazzano et al.202 evaluated non-soy legume consumption on total cholesterol levels in 10 tri -
als representing 268 subjects.

Bazzano et al.202 evaluated non-soy legume consumption on total cholesterol levels in 10 tri -
als representing 268 subjects.

The mean net change in total cholesterol on a non-soy legume
diet was −11.8 mg/dL (95% CI: −16.1 to −7.5) and for LDL cholesterol, −8.0 mg/dL (95% CI:
−11.4 to −4.6).

Larsson et al.203 followed 26,556 Finnish male smokers for 13.6 years and found 119 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
that vegetable fiber intake, in addition to the consumption of fruit, vegetables, and cereals, was
inversely associated with risk of stroke.

sweeteners
There is an overwhelming preponderance of added sugars such as sucrose and high-fructose corn
syrup in the current diet, increasing the risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and CVD due
to consequences such as dyslipidemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress.204,205 As a result, public
health recommendations, such as those put forth by the American Heart Association, advocate
reductions in added sugar intake from high-added sugar foods such as soft drinks, fruit drinks,
desserts, sugars and jellies, candy, and ready-to-eat cereal, with no more than 100 and 150 cal for
American women and men per day, respectively.206
Fructose is further implicated in cardiovascular concerns due to its ability to increase tri -
glycerides and uric acid,204 although there is discussion that low dietary amounts of fructose are
beneficial while high excessive intake is associated with these metabolic impairments.207,208 The
work of Le et al.209 suggests that there may even be intraindividual differences in the response to
fructose linked with SNPs in genes involved in fructose transport, which can alter cardiometa -
bolic risk.

Select risk factors for CVD have been shown to be impacted by dietary sugar intake.

There are
studies emerging to indicate a potential relationship between sugar-sweetened beverage consump -
tion and hypertension.210–213 In the Framingham Heart Study cohort, Dhingra et al.213 noted that
individuals who consumed as little as one or more soft drinks per day had increased incidence of
high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol.

Similarly, fasting triglycerides
appear to be elevated in the presence of high intakes (>20% of energy) of sugars (sucrose, glucose,
and fructose) with more marked effects in specific populations such as (1) men compared with
women, (2) those who are sedentary overweight or have metabolic syndrome, and (3) those indi -
viduals consuming low fiber,214–217 thus warranting specific dietary recommendations for certain
patient populations.

Additionally, postprandial triglyceride elevations may be augmented by sucrose
and fructose.218,219
Although artificial sweeteners have been the subject of concern for metabolic disturbances and
obesity, there is limited information available with respect to their impact on CVD.

In one study,220
three different artificial sweeteners (aspartame, acesulfame K, and saccharin) were found to exhibit
proatherogenic and senescence properties in vitro , with implications for impairment in structure
and function of apoA-I and HDL cholesterol.

PHytonutrient -ricH Foods
A number of the natural plant foods that comprise healthful dietary patterns have been shown to
have particularly pronounced cardiovascular health benefits.221 These phytonutrient-rich plant foods
are referred to as functional foods, which by definition are “foods that, by virtue of physiologi -
cally active food components, provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition.”222 The construction of
therapeutic diets based on combinations of functional foods has been shown to be an effective and
practical approach to cardiovascular risk reduction.223
Fruits and vegetables
A higher intake of fruits and vegetables has consistently been associated with a lower incidence
of CVD in a dose-dependent fashion.

A meta-analysis of nine observational cohort studies includ -
ing 91,379 men and 129,701 women found fruit and vegetable consumption reduced CHD risk by
4% to 7% for each additional portion per day of vegetables or fruits, respectively.224 A similar
dose-dependent relationship was revealed in a meta-analysis examining the relationship between 120 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
fruit and vegetable intake and risk of stroke.225 An intervention with a higher fruit and vegetables
diet in hypertensive patients was found to improve endothelial function, again in a dose-dependent
relationship.226
Fruits and vegetables are rich in important nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phy -
tochemicals, but they are low in energy, sodium, and TFAs and tend to displace unhealthy foods,
making them a vital component of a dietary cardiovascular health plan.227 The health benefits of
fruits and vegetables appear to be in part due to their ability to reduce inflammation and oxidative
stress.228 Importantly, the anti-inflammatory effect of fruits and vegetables may be related more to a
wider dietary variety of foods than the absolute amount, which from a practical standpoint empha -
sizes the importance of dietary diversity.229
leguMes
Consumption of legumes has been associated with a lower CVD risk, and clinical intervention
studies have suggested cardiovascular-protective effects.

A large epidemiological study in the U.S.
population revealed an association between legume consumption and reduced risk of CHD.

Soy
foods in particular have attracted attention for cardiovascular health because of their favorable
nutritional profile.230 However, the available evidence suggests than non-soy legumes (e.g., beans
such as pinto, kidney, and lima beans and peas such as split green peas or lentils) may be equally
beneficial for heart health.202
wHole grains
Whole grains are rich in dietary fiber, micronutrients, phytosterols, and other phytochemicals and
may reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and improve hyperlipidemia, blood pressure and vas -
cular function.231 A meta-analysis of clinical trials and prospective cohort studies estimated that
people consuming three to five servings per day have an approximately 20% lower risk of CVD
compared with rarely or never consumers of whole grains.232
Advise to consume whole grains may improve weight loss and CVD risk.

Obese adults with
metabolic syndrome, who were advised to consume whole grains in addition to a hypocaloric diet
had a significantly greater reduction in CRP and percentage body fat in the abdominal region when
compared to those eating their grain allowance as refined grains.233
nuts
The benefits of nuts for cardiovascular health have been consistently demonstrated across a num -
ber of observational studies and clinical trials.234 Mechanisms for the benefits of nut consumption
include cholesterol-lowering effects, reductions in oxidative stress, inflammation, and improve -
ments in vascular reactivity.235
Nuts are phytonutrient dense (including high-quality vegetable protein, fiber, minerals, tocopher -
ols, phytosterols, and phenolic compounds) and rich in unsaturated fatty acids.236 Despite being high
in fat, regular nut consumption does not appear to induce weight gain.237 In fact, a 12-month study
of a Mediterranean diet supplemented with 30 g of nuts per day found a decrease in prevalence of
metabolic syndrome, mainly due to reduced visceral adiposity.238
The effects of even modest nut consumption on CVD outcomes are striking.

For example, in
individuals with high cardiovascular risk a longitudinal cohort study found that subjects who con -
sumed greater than three servings of nuts per week at baseline had a 55% lower risk of cardiovas -
cular mortality.239 Similarly, two large prospective cohort studies found a 20% reduction in total
mortality, including CVD, with consumption of nuts seven or more times per week compared to
those who ate no nuts.240121 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
olive oil
Olive oil is the major source of calories in the traditional Mediterranean diet and beyond simply
being rich in MUFAs is also an important source of phytochemicals naturally present in the oil.241
There is an important distinction between “olive oil” and “extra virgin olive oil” with the former
refined and virtually devoid of phytochemicals, whereas the latter contains up to 1 g/kg of these
important substances.242 Within the oily matrix of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), there is a rich array
of bioactive compounds including triterpenes, phytosterols, flavonoids, and lignans.

These bioactive
compounds are thought to be a major reason for the health benefits of virgin olive oil.243
The fatty acid composition of EVOO also account for its health effects.

Oleic acid is the
predominant MUFA in olive oil comprising 55%–83% of the total fatty acids and is thought to
account for many of the unique effects of olive when compared to other vegetable oils.

Oleic acid
may play an important role in the beneficial effects of EVOO on postprandial metabolism including
insulin release, nitric oxide bioavailability, vasodilation, blood pressure, inflammation, and blood
coagulation.244
A large observational study in a Spanish cohort demonstrated a 26% lower risk of CVD and
44% reduction in overall mortality in the highest quartile of olive oil consumption.245 Consumption
of 30 mL of polyphenol-rich olive oil for 2 months in hypertensive women led to improvement in
endothelial function, a significant decrease of 7.91 mmHg in systolic and 6.65 mmHg of diastolic
blood pressure, and reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress.246
cocoa
Cocoa is a rich source of polyphenols, and cocoa and dark chocolate consumption has been asso -
ciated with impressive cardiovascular health benefits in observational studies.247 The combined
data from seven large-scale population studies (with a combined total of 114,009 participants),
for  example, revealed that the highest levels of chocolate consumption was associated with a 37%
reduction in heart disease, a 31% reduction in diabetes, and a 29% reduction in stroke compared
with the lowest levels.248
A number of controlled clinical trials have also shown consistent acute and chronic bene -
fits of cocoa on flow-mediated dilatation and insulin resistance, although it was concluded that
more research is required to confirm the potential clinical benefits of cocoa as a cardiovascular
medicine.249
tea
Tea is a rich source of polyphenols, a class of phytonutrients with several important cardiopro -
tective effects.

Consumption of both green and black teas had been associated with a significant
reduction in CHD and stroke risk in epidemiological studies with estimates ranging from a 10% to
20% reduction in disease risk.250
Robust support for the protective effects of teas comes from a meta-analysis of prospective
cohort studies, which found a statistically significant inverse association between tea consumption
and risk of stroke.251 The analysis also revealed a dose-dependent relationship with each increase of
three cups per day in tea consumption associated with a 13% reduction in stroke risk.

A relevant clinical trial demonstrated that black tea consumption (three cups per day) for 6
months significantly reduced 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure by between
2 and 3 mmHg, an effect that at a population level would be associated with a 10% reduction in the
prevalence of hypertension and a 7%–10% reduction in the risk of CVD.252
An interaction between a slow allele of the CYP1A2 genotype, a caffeine-metabolizing enzyme,
has been associated with increased risk for hypertension and nonfatal myocardial infarction in
regular coffee drinkers.253,254 However, it is unknown if tea, which contains a different group of
bioactives and lower caffeine content than coffee, would have the same effect.122 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
carotenoids
Carotenoids are natural pigments found in deeply colored yellow, orange, red, and dark green
plants as well as in some animal source foods (e.g., salmon and egg yolks).

Some of the best-
studied carotenoids include beta-carotene, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin.

A primary
mechanism for the cardioprotective effects of carotenoids appears to be their ability to reduce
oxidant stress and subsequently atherosclerosis progression.

Indeed, there may be a relation -
ship between carotenoid intake and reduced intima-media thickness of common carotid artery
wall.255
A particularly prominent relationship has been found between dietary carotenoid intake and
cardiovascular risk, although it may be that carotenoid intake is simply a surrogate marker of higher
fruit and vegetable consumption.256 In Finnish men, the highest quartile of serum lycopene concen -
tration was associated with 59% and 55% lower risks of ischemic stroke and any stroke, compared
with men in the lowest quartile.

Similarly, men with the lowest quartile of serum β-carotene had an
approximately threefold increased risk of CHF.257
Increasing consumption of foods that are rich in carotenoids may improve cardiovascular risk.

A 7-day intervention with red orange juice (500 mL/day) significantly improved endothelial func -
tion and reduced inflammation in adults with increased cardiovascular risk.258 Supplementation
with 70 g of tomato paste over a period of 14 days improved endothelial function (measured with
flow-mediated dilatation) and reduced serum oxidative stress.259
PolyPHenols /Flavonoids
Flavonoids are the most common class of polyphenolic phytochemicals consumed in a plant-based
diet.

Although major food sources of flavonoids vary depending on dietary habits and culture, some
of the richest and most frequently consumed dietary sources of flavonoids include soy foods, whole
grains, tea, apples, onions, cocoa, wine, and citrus fruits.260
Flavonoids and flavonoid-rich foods have marked antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity
and may reduce blood cholesterol oxidation and improve endothelial function.261 Intakes of various
flavonoids has been inversely associated with lower serum CRP concentrations in U.S. adults, even
after adjustment for fruit and vegetable consumption, suggesting an important role of flavonoid-rich
foods in reducing cardiovascular risk.262
A large prospective cohort study of almost 100,000 U.S. men and women identified a lower risk
of fatal CVD with greater intake of total flavonoids.

Interestingly, most of the apparent benefits of
dietary flavonoids appeared with modest intakes, suggesting beneficial effects occur even with rela -
tively small amounts of flavonoid-rich foods.263
Currently, there is considerable supportive evidence to suggest that increasing dietary intake of
flavonoid-rich foods (e.g., apples, cocoa, soy, and tea) and, to a lesser extent purified dietary supple -
ments, may modify biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, in particular blood pressure and endothelial
function.264
nitrates
Dietary nitrate has received increasing interest as a major reason for the cardiovascular benefits
of vegetables-rich diets.

Dietary nitrate, which is predominately found in vegetables and some
fruits, plays an important role in vascular homeostasis.

Nitrate is utilized in the biosynthesis
of nitric oxide and as a consequence plays an important role in endothelial function, vascular
relaxation, and platelet aggregation.

Subsequently, nitrate may be important for the treatment
and prevention of CVD.265
Dietary nitrate (NO3) is absorbed rapidly in the small intestine with 100% bioavailability,
once in the blood stream about 25% of the nitrate concentrates in the salivary glands where it 123 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
is secreted back into the mouth and metabolized and converted by commensal bacteria on the
tongue into nitrite (NO2).

The nitrite is then swallowed and absorbed directly in the stomach.

Nitrite can be reduced to form nitric oxide (NO), a molecule of crucial importance for cardio -
vascular health.266 Of relevance, antiseptic mouthwash can almost completely impede oral nitrite
production.267
Nitrate is also produced in your skin in response to ultraviolet light (UVA), much like vitamin D.
In fact, one experiment found that exposure to UVA light resulted in a significant reduction in sys -
tolic and diastolic blood pressure of 11% within just 30 minutes and the effects persisted for at least
an hour.268 But it is dietary source that makes the vast contribution to your daily nitrate exposure,
which has been estimated to be 81–106 mg/day in the typical Western diet.269
Supplementation with dietary nitrate or nitrate-rich vegetables may have important cardiovas -
cular benefits.

An acute meal of nitrate-rich spinach augmented nitric oxide status, enhanced endo -
thelial function, and lowered blood pressure in healthy men and women.270 Using beetroot juice
as a source of nitrate it was found that daily beetroot juice was able to significantly reduce blood
pressure in free-living healthy adults.271 A 10-day study of a high nitrate traditional Japanese diet
increased plasma nitrite and nitrate levels and lowered diastolic blood pressure by an average of
4.5 mmHg compared to Western style diet.272
Increasing dietary intake of nitrate via vegetable and vegetables juices may prove to be an impor -
tant consideration when constructing a heart-healthy diet.

Foods that are particularly high in dietary
nitrate include celery, celeriac, chervil, Chinese cabbage, cress, endive, fennel, kohlrabi, leek, let -
tuce, parsley, red beetroot, spinach, and rocket.273
Probiotics /Prebiotics
Probiotic bacteria are increasingly found in foods including cultured milks, yogurt, functional
foods, and dietary supplements.

There is some evidence to suggest that probiotic bacteria may have
functional cardiovascular benefits, in particular, the ability to lower LDL cholesterol.

A number of
human clinical studies have suggested that certain probiotic supplements or fermented milk prod -
ucts may favorably influence serum LDL cholesterol.274
In one such study, hyperlipidemic patients who revived Lactobacillus sporogenes  for 90 days
showed a 35% and 32% decrease in their LDL and total cholesterol levels, respectively.275 There
may also be benefits beyond cholesterol lowering; administration of Lactobacillus plantarum

tive stress.276 It is important to note, however, that each probiotic strain, independent of its
genus and species, has unique properties and health effects.

Thus, clinical applications cannot
be generalized across all probiotics, and a therapeutic strain must be selected based on proven
effects.277
Prebiotic plant fibers may also benefit cardiovascular health via their influence on the gastroin -
testinal microflora.

A number of potential mechanisms of prebiotics have been proposed to account
for their association with CVD including improvements in body weight, glucose homeostasis,
plasma lipid profile, and reductions in inflammation.278 A clinical trial in overweight adults found
that supplementation with prebiotic galactooligosaccharides was able to improve composition of the
gut microbiota and reduce plasma CRP, insulin, total cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations
within 12 weeks.279
Interestingly, pre- and probiotics may impact cardiometabolic health via reductions in circulat -
ing endotoxin.

Western dietary patterns can result in alterations in the gut microbiota that favor
production of gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) and increase circulating lev -
els, a phenomena that has been termed low-grade metabolic endotoxemia.280 Low-grade metabolic
endotoxemia has been associated with cardiovascular risk in a linear fashion.385 Modulation of the
gut flora with pre- and probiotics may be an important approach to reducing low-grade metabolic
endotoxemia and improving cardiometabolic health.280124 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
SUMMARY
Overall, there is clearly strong evidence that food and food constituents impact CVD risk and
even aspects of CVD such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic disturbance.

Dietary
patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and DASH diet have sufficient evidence to warrant their
use in the general population with CVD prevention concerns.

There is general consensus that a
healthy dietary portfolio of whole, unprocessed, mainly plant-based foods, including high pro -
portions of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, olives, as well as limited amounts of
cocoa, and tea, may be helpful for addressing mechanisms related to CVD such as cholesterol,
blood pressure, endothelial function, inflammation, stress response, and insulin sensitivity (see
Figure 6.2).

Specific delineation of amounts of these foods and their bioactives can be found in
Table 6.1.

As research continues to plug the existing knowledge gaps, there will be increasing scope to
tailor a unique dietary prescription for CVD prevention to an individual’s genomic information,
including genes, polymorphisms, and even epigenetics.

Personalization of nutrition along with rel -
evant lifestyle factors for CVD, such as physical activity, will ultimately produce the most beneficial
health outcomes.

FIGURE 6.2  Healing the heart with whole foods and food bioactives.

Each meal has potent acute and
cumulative cardiovascular effects.

A whole food, dietary pattern can influence global cardiovascular health
and powerfully influence morbidity and mortality.

Reduction in energy density appears to delay cardiovas -
cular aging.

Low-heat, slow-cooking methods (low-AGE cooking) may reduce the inflammatory and oxida -
tive potential of food.

And functional prebiotic-, polyphenol-, and nitrate-rich foods can be used to improve
cardiometabolic health.125 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
TABLE 6.1
Foods and Bioactives for Cardiovascular Health
Food category Bioactive components Effects on cardiovascular health Guidance for consumption
Fruits and vegetables Fruits and vegetables are
abundant in fiber,
vitamins, minerals,
nitrates, and phytochemi-
cals, including carotenoids
such as beta-carotene,
zeaxanthin, lycopene, and
astaxanthin.

Dark leafy
green vegetables contain
short-chain omega-3 fatty
acids and folic acid.

Garlic
contains allicin, the active
ingredient thought to
combat hypertension and
high cholesterol.281 Fruits
and vegetables are also
low in energy, sodium,
saturated fatty acids,
and TFAs.

High K and Mg
Increase K/Na ratio from
4 to 5:1.Epidemiological data strongly associates fruit and vegetable
intake with reduced risk for CVD.282 Each additional portion
of fruit and vegetables consumed reduces the risk of CHD by
4%, and each portion of fruit alone can reduce risk by up to
7%.224 High carotenoid levels may also provide a two-third
reduction in the risk of CHF.257 Carotenoids are also
associated with lower CRP levels,262 reduced oxidative stress,
atherosclerosis, and reduced thickening of the arterial
wall.264,228
For those with hypertension, fruits and vegetables improve
endothelial function226 and their naturally occurring nitrates
reduce blood pressure.264,265,270–272 Garlic also lowers blood
pressure in those with hypertension.283 In addition, for those
with elevated total cholesterol levels, garlic consumption can
lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.284Consume at least eight servings of a variety of fruits and
vegetables per day.229,282,285 Include plenty of dark green leafy
vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and vitamin C–rich fruits
and vegetables, since higher consumption of these foods is
associated with the lowest risk for heart disease.286
To improve cholesterol levels, include garlic,284 kiwifruit,287 and
strawberries.288 To lower blood pressure, include vegetables
with higher nitrite content such as celery, cress, chervil, lettuce,
red beetroot, spinach, rocket (arugula), celeriac, Chinese
cabbage, endive, fennel, kohlrabi, leek, and parsley.273 The
benefits of beetroot, orange, and garlic for lowering blood
pressure, in particular, have been investigated
specifically.271,284,289
Daily consumption of antioxidant produce, including
pomegranate grape, blueberry, tomato (including tomato paste),
kiwi, and orange, will also enhance the vascular activity of
nitric oxide, improve endothelial function, and protect against
oxidative damage.258,259,287,290,291  High levels of antioxidant
carotenoids are found in yellow, orange, red, and dark green
plants, and their bioavailability can be improved by cooking.

(continued )126 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular MedicineTABLE 6.1 ( Continued  )
Foods and Bioactives for Cardiovascular Health
Food category Bioactive components Effects on cardiovascular health Guidance for consumption
Legumes Legumes contain soluble
dietary fiber, vegetable
protein, oligosaccharides,
isoflavones, phospholipids,
MUFAs and PUFAs,
saponins, and antioxi-
dants.293 Vitamins and
minerals are also
abundant, including
folic acid, which
promotes homocysteine
metabolism.293
Legumes provide
high-quality vegetable
protein, fiber, vitamins,
and minerals in a low-GI,
low-GL, and low-fat food.Legume consumption is associated with lower overall CHD
risk.230 Isoflavones, found especially in soy beans, have
antioxidant, antithrombotic, antiplatelet aggregation, and
anti-inflammatory activity, as well as positive effects on blood
cholesterol levels.293
Although the benefits of soy have received much research
attention,98,99,230,282 non-soy legumes such as pinto, kidney,
and lima beans, split peas, and lentils may be equally if not
more beneficial.202,293–295 For example, non-soy legumes,
including pulses, have significantly favorable effects on
serum lipids including total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol,202,293 as well as blood
pressure–lowering effects.198
No less important, adequate protein and fiber, as provided by
legumes and other heart-healthy whole foods, are important
for satiety and adherence to a calorie-restricted diet.61Consume legumes daily; at least 2/3 cup of cooked dried beans
or 1/2 cup of canned beans per day.98,293,294 Once again, variety
is beneficial, including soy beans, pinto beans, kidney beans,
lima beans, split peas, lentils, chickpeas (garbanzo beans),
black-eyed peas, and navy beans.

Legumes can be consumed instead of white potatoes and white
rice, as well as served in chilis, stews, soups, and casseroles.

Legume flours, such as chickpea or soy bean flour, can be
included in breads and baked goods.

Avoid soy-containing
processed foods, however, including some processed meats,
since these have been found to increase CVD risk.282
Fish Fish contain long-chain
omega-3 fatty acids (EPA
and DHA).

Some fish
contain additional
beneficial bioactives
including ACEI,126–128
carotenoids, and
selenium.119Regular fish consumption is strongly associated with
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health.119,120–122,296
Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids appear to favorably alter
lipoprotein profiles299 and reduce inflammation markers,
including as CRP300 and Lp(a),130 most reliably when
consumed from dietary sources rather than supplements298
and from oily fish rather than nonoily fish.299 Other bioactive
components found in fish may have cardioprotective effects,
explaining some of the mixed results seen in trials using
isolated supplements.298
Fish oil intake is associated with lower incidence of
hypertension,300,301  which may be promoted by ACEI present
in fish that work against the hypertension-promotion of
ACEI.120,125–128Consuming fish 1 to 2 times per week is associated with a 36%
reduction in CVD risk,120 and even greater protective effects are
seen with intakes of 2–4 times or 5 + times per week.121,122
Daily intake significantly lowers Lp(a) levels.130
The highest concentrations of EPA and DHA can be found in
salt water fish such as herring, salmon, sardines, and
oysters.302,303  Fish with ACEI include bonito,125 tuna,136 and
sardines.137 Choose a variety of fish with low mercury content,
especially when consuming at higher frequency levels.119,120
Avoid fish known to have high mercury content including
shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and albacore tuna
(light tuna is a safer choice).

Look for fresh sources where
possible, since smoking or other preservation techniques can
result in high levels of salt.304127 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
Olive oil Olive oil contains oleic
acid, a MUFA, vitamin E,
as well as phenols241,182
such as oleuropein,
hydroxytyrosol, and
tyrosol.305,306 One phenolic
compound, secoiridoids, is
unique to olives.306As part of a Mediterranean diet, olive oil consumption is
associated with decreased rates of CVD morbidity and
mortality.182,245 Although oleic acid was the first component
investigated for heart health, other bioactives have since been
recognized as beneficial.

The phenolic antioxidant
compounds and vitamin E found in olive oil have anti-
inflammatory activity, reduce LDL oxidation,181,182,305–308
improve HDL cholesterol,181,313 and decrease prothrombotic
effects.

Olive oil has also been shown to improve endothelial
function.247,305,309 Not least, varieties rich in polyphenols
appear to lower blood pressure,246,310–312 even outshining the
effects of MUFAs.310,31210–30 mL (about 2–6 tbsp) of polyphenol-rich olive oil per day
has been shown to exert positive effects on systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, endothelial function, inflammation,
and oxidative stress.246,308,313 Interestingly, neither safflower oil
nor sunflower oil, both rich in MUFAs have been found to have
the same benefits.314,315 The level of polyphenols appears to be
important for enhancing the beneficial effects.182,183,309,316,317
They are found at higher levels in unrefined, EVOOs306 and
give certain olive oils their characteristic bitter and astringent
taste.

Nuts Nuts are generally high in
MUFAs and PUFAs,
including omega-3 fatty
acids, with a lower ratio of
saturated fats.

In addition,
nuts contain important
high-quality protein,
vitamins, minerals, fiber,
phytosterols, and phenolic
compounds,236 reservatrol
and arginine.282Strong evidence from large population studies and clinical
trials supports nut consumption for cardiovascular
health,28,234,236,314,318–320 which may reduce risk by up to
35%.282 Regular consumption also reduces the risk of sudden
cardiac death,235 which may be due to antiarrhythmic
properties.321
Various trials show that nuts can also reduce total
cholesterol117,314,322–325  and LDL cholesterol.170,316,322,324–330
There is also some evidence that nuts can lower
triglycerides322 and apolipoprotein B.314,325  Additional benefits
include reduced inflammation and LDL oxidation,235,236,329,330
as well as improved endothelial function, and vascular
reactivity.235,331
Although not all studies agree on the effects of nuts on blood
pressure, there is some promising evidence,295,332  which
thought to be partly mediated by l-arginine present in nuts
and a precursor to nitric oxide.

Nitric oxide has important
roles in maintaining endothelial function and reducing blood
pressure via vasodilation.The cardiovascular benefits of nut consumption increase in a
dose-dependent manner,318,323,333 with improvements seen even
with consumption of 1 oz once a week.319 However, the greatest
benefits appearing when 1 oz nuts are consumed five or more
times per week.314,319
Among the varieties tested, the most potent cholesterol-lowering
nuts appear to be walnuts, peanuts, and pistachios, followed
closely by almonds, and then pecans and macadamia nuts.327
Almonds and pecans have also been studied for their ability to
reduce oxidized LDL,327,329  and other nuts including Brazil nuts
and hazelnuts (filberts) also confer cardiovascular benefits.319
Nuts consumed in their unprocessed, whole form (including
skins, but not shells) contain higher levels of antioxidants236
and appear to counter the risks of weight gain326 as well as
protect against oxidation of their unsaturated fatty acids.

blanching.236,335  Avoid bleached pistachios since many of their
antioxidants are destroyed by the bleaching process.336
(continued )128 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular MedicineTABLE 6.1 ( Continued  )
Foods and Bioactives for Cardiovascular Health
Food category Bioactive components Effects on cardiovascular health Guidance for consumption
Whole grains Soluble and insoluble fiber,
vitamins, minerals,
antioxidants, phytosterols,
and other
phytoche- micals.231,337Whole grain consumption is associated with lower CVD
mortality, an effect that is not found by consuming refined
grains.338–340 Cereal fiber found in whole grains may reduce
CVD risk even more than fruit and vegetable fibers.197
Consumption of whole grains is associated with lower levels
of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol,201,282,341–343 as well as
with the lowest BMI, weight, and waist circumference.341,342
Whole grains can also reduce inflammation and oxidative
stress199,200,231,233 as well as lower blood pressure.340,201At least three servings per day should be consumed to reduce the
risk for CVD.201,231,232 Aim to include grains with soluble fiber
such as oats, since soluble fiber is found to have greater effects
on reducing blood pressure.198 Oats and barley also contain a
specific form of fiber, β-glucan, which has cholesterol-lowering
properties.282,342–346
Flaxseed Short-chain omega-3 fatty
acids ( α-linolenic acid),
lignans, as well as soluble
and insoluble fibers.Flaxseeds address dyslipidemia by lowering total cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol,347–350 and the LDL:HDL ratio.171 This effect
is thought be imparted by their lignans and fiber content.349,171
Flaxseeds may also reduce triglycerides and apolipoprotein
B, although the evidence is less clear.349,350
Some studies have also found a beneficial effect on blood
pressure, including a large, ongoing prospective study.173,332
Additional cardioprotective phytoestrogens are produced
from the flaxseed lignans by bacteria in the human gut.353,354
The anti-inflammatory effects of flaxseed172,353  are thought to
originate from short-chain omega-3 fatty acids, which can be
partly converted in the body into long-chain omega-3 fatty
acids, and then integrated into cellular membranes where
their anti-inflammatory activity can be carried out.172To reduce cholesterol levels, choose whole or ground flaxseed or
lignans,353 since flaxseed oil lacks the fiber and usually also the
lignans that provide the desired effect.348,354 Mixing the flax
with liquid to dissolve the viscous fiber may be of additional
benefit.347 Flaxseed oil may still be useful, however, for its
anti-inflammatory omega-3 content.354
Although clinical trials have used varying amounts of flaxseed, it
appears that 1–4 tbsp of ground flaxseed per day may be
enough to generate positive effects on cholesterol, blood
pressure, and other markers associated with cardiovascular
disease.350129 Healing the Heart with Whole Foods and Food Bioactives
Cocoa The benefits of cocoa
consumption are thought
to be derived from its
flavonols.247Multiple population studies have shown an inverse association
between cocoa consumption and cardiovascular mortality and
morbidity.247,248,355
Clinical trials have also shown that cocoa can reduce total
cholesterol and LDL cholesterol,356 as well as improve
flow-mediated dilation357 and modestly reduce blood
pressure.247,357–360
Cocoa appears to increase nitric oxide levels, thereby
improving endothelial function and flow-mediated dilation.247
An inverse association between consumption of cocoa and
dark chocolate, and hypertension has also been noted.247
Potent antioxidant and antiplatelet aggregation activity may
also contribute to the cardiovascular benefits.247Small quantities of dark chocolate or cocoa consumed daily are
the best choice due to its high caloric content.282,357
The flavonol content of cocoa is reduced by processing,
including fermentation and roasting,247 Raw cocoa is, therefore,
an option that maintains higher flavonol levels.

Dark chocolate
is also a better choice than milk or white chocolate, which have
the lowest flavonol levels and have not been found to have the
same benefits.247,361
Tea Polyphenols, the most studied
of which are the catechins,
in particular epigallocatechin
gallate, found especially in
green tea.Moderate tea consumption is associated with a lower risk of
CVD in epidemiological studies.362–365 Studies have shown
that black tea and green tea can decrease blood pressure252,366
and blood pressure variability.367 A cholesterol-lowering
effect has also been found for green tea357,366,368,369 and
possibly also black tea.366 Green tea’s hypocholesterolemic
effects are thought to be achieved by increasing the excretion
of cholesterol-rich bile acid.370
In addition, the catechins found in teas have antioxidant
activity, which may protect against LDL oxidation.369 These
components have also been found to improve endothelial
function by increasing nitric oxide bioavailability and
inhibiting reactive oxygen species.369,370  They may also inhibit
smooth muscle proliferation in the vascular walls.370Up to 3 cups of tea per day have been found to deliver
cardiovascular benefits.252,367 More is not necessarily better.273
In fact, consuming 5 cups/day of black or green tea may
actually increase blood pressure.372 Avoid adding bovine milk
or soy milk, since this may counteract the vascular
benefits.373,374
Although black tea has been found to deliver benefits, green tea
contains more antioxidant activity, since black tea catechins are
lost during its more extensive processing.375 In addition, there is
evidence that green tea is more effective at improving lipid
profiles and reducing CVD risk than black tea.282,375
Other teas such as Redbush (rooibos) tea may also be considered.

Redbush tea has been found to improve lipid profiles and
antioxidant status376 and may also inhibit angiotensin-converting
enzyme, thereby favorably affecting blood pressure.377
Note:  Diets that provide known cardioprotective and therapeutic effects are rich in plant foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds.

Moderate consumption of
fish, olive oil, cocoa, and tea has also shown benefits.

These fundamental principles share many of the characteristics of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH recommendations, and tradi -
tional diets such as that of the Okinawans, who have unusually low rates of chronic disease, including cardiovascular conditions.

In addition, calorie restriction, such as practiced by the
Okinawans and food preparation techniques are increasingly realized as important potential influencers of cardiovascular health.

This guide is intended to bridge the gap between typical
recommended intakes of nutrients and calories, and practical advice for implementing dietary changes, recognizing that people eat food first, not nutrients.130 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine

Although many etiological
factors may be involved in this situation, one hypothesis is that a well-recognized increased con -
sumption of sugars and refined carbohydrates (CHO) such as sucrose and high fructose corn syrup
(HFCS) plays a pivotal role in the increase of these unwanted entities.

Overindulgence, coupled with
a rapid absorption (high glycemic load) and, in some cases, excess fructose content of these foods
are believed to be important contributors to insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes (IR/T2D) that may
be the responsible, shared factor behind the increased incidence of obesity, hypertension, dyslipid -
emias, and coagulation perturbations.

If this scenario is correct to any extent, then suitable lifestyle
changes could be to some extent corrective.

However, dietary restrictions and enhanced exercise
programs are not easy alternatives for too many people.

Accordingly, drugs, particularly antidia -
betic drugs, have been tried as preventatives.

Although drugs seem to have some benefit while
in use, long-term use is somewhat limited due to their poor history of serious adverse reactions.

Fortunately, many safe, inexpensive dietary supplements exist that have been shown to beneficially
influence IR/T2D, and thus, may favorably influence other elements present in the MS.
To sum up, the major purpose of this chapter is to bring to light the possibility that effective and
safe dietary supplements should be examined to aid in the quest to ameliorate the different elements
of the MS that currently trouble individuals, especially during the aging process.

ASSOCIATION OF DIETARY SUGARS AND REFINED CARBOHYDRATES
WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME
bacKground
The alarming increased incidence of many chronic human maladies, especially those occurring
most frequently during aging, such as glucose–insulin disturbances (IR/T2D), overweight/obesity,
hypertension, and dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia and low circulating levels of high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) presents a significant health problem for the United States as well
as countries throughout the world.1–6 These prominent chronic disorders along with other perturba -
tions, such as a prothrombic state caused by increased levels of fibrinogen/plasminogen activator
inhibitor in the blood and a high proinflammatory state indicated by elevated C-reactive protein
in the blood, are commonly lumped together as the “metabolic syndrome (MS)” because of their
repeated association7,8 (see Table 7.1).

In the past, this collection of pathological conditions was also
referred to as “syndrome X.”9,10
In addition to the physical harm caused by MS, the monetary costs stress personal and national
financial reserves.

A good estimate regarding the overall adult population in the United States
toward the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century is that 8.3% were diabetic,11 34.9%
were obese,12 18%–32%—depending on age—were hypertensive,5 and overall 31% possessed high
circulating triglyceride levels.6 Unfortunately, none of these approximations have shown a notice -
able downward movement; instead, most reliable observers believe the trends may be increasing.

PatHogenesis
Because of the frequent common occurrence among components of the syndrome, many believe
that a shared underlying pathogenesis exists, at least for many of the cases.

PatHogenesis
Because of the frequent common occurrence among components of the syndrome, many believe
that a shared underlying pathogenesis exists, at least for many of the cases.

The perturbation most
widely favored as underlying the development of the many components of the MS is IR.9,10,13 IR is a
disorder in which peripheral tissues such as muscle and fat do not respond adequately to circulating
insulin, and so with IR, it takes much more of insulin to bring about a normal effect.13 A common
result is development of both hyperglycemia and compensatory hyperinsulinemia.149 Potential of Diet and Dietary Supplementation
IR is relatively ubiquitous possibly due, at least in part, to its close association with obesity, a
disorder like other elements of MS that is increasing in epidemic proportions.8,14–22 Fat accumula -
tion, particularly in the abdomen and liver (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, [NAFLD]), has received
considerable attention over the last few years as a principal causative factor.10 In the past, we have
presented at lectures a slide with the title of “A Deadly Triangle” depicted in Figure 7.1.

This figure
suggests that a reasonable way to ameliorate the various elements of MS is to prevent IR and/or
obesity.

It may be that fat accumulation only exacerbates the events caused by IR as the incidence
of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or T2D does not generally increase in obese individuals without
some evidence for the presence of IR.10,23,24 Therefore, ameliorating IR and obesity could slow the
development of the other age-related maladies, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia.

IR, like MS
itself, has been linked to the hypercoagulable state and increased cytokine levels (Figure 7.1).22
Accordingly, it is not too surprising that preventing and/or ameliorating IR/T2D and overweight/
obesity are important measures in the current therapeutic efforts, although it remains somewhat
controversial whether and to what extent overweight/obesity causes IR.10 Suffice it to say, natural
lifestyle measures that enhance insulin sensitivity and/or decrease fat mass such as proper diet and
exercise have shown promise against the components of MS.25 The addition of “weight loss” and
antidiabetic drugs to lifestyle changes may provide further help; however, the extra benefits derived
from such pharmaceutical regimens generally disappear when these regimens are discontinued.26–35
The eventual removal of a drug often is carried out as a precaution based on an established his -
tory of the use of such weight loss and antidiabetic drugs being implicated with significant adverse
reactions.36–39TABLE 7.1
Diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome
Criteria vary slightly among different groups.

According to guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
(NHLBI) and the American Heart Association (AHA), metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when a patient has at least three
of the following four conditions:
1.

Insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus
Fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL (or receiving drug therapy for hyperglycemia)
2.

Elevated blood pressure
BP ≥130/85 mmHg (or receiving drug therapy for hypertension)
3.

Dyslipidemia
Triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL (or receiving drug therapy for hypertriglyceridemia)
HDL-C < 40 mg/dL in men or <50 mg/dL in women (or receiving drug therapy for reduced HDL-C)
4.

Central overweight/obesity
Waist circumference ≥40 in.

in men or 35 in.

in women; if Asian-American, ≥35 in.

in men or 32 in.

Assuming that IR is an important factor in the increasing occurrence of the many components
that constitute the MS, we believe the so-called “Western diet,” which is high in refined CHO such
as sugars and low in fibers, is a significant contributor to the current deteriorating state of American
health.

Consumption of sugars, especially sucrose and HFCS, is increasing worldwide.

Excess sugar
consumption is closely tied to IR based on at least two known mechanisms.

First, excess sugar con -
sumption provides unneeded calories that cause increased fat accumulation that in turn indirectly
influences glucose–insulin metabolism and other hormonal systems unfavorably.

Second, excess
sugar intake itself perturbs many hormonal systems, particularly the glucose–insulin system, by
directly inducing IR, i.e., a diet high in sugar(s) alters liver function and influences peripheral tis -
sues, both fat and muscle, to respond inadequately to insulin.

Practically speaking, averting the MS by merely avoiding dietary sugars in modern Western
diets through conscious effort may be very difficult to achieve.

There are many reasons for this.

Sugars and refined CHO components today are cheap and readily available ingredients—ubiquitous
in food processing.

For another, most individuals of all ages love sweets.

Some experts have even
proposed the existence of an addiction to refined foods, especially to sugars.40
INSULIN RESISTANCE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS
Insulin was discovered and isolated by the Banting group in Toronto, Canada, in the early 1920s.41–44
With this discovery, most physicians reasoned that a lack of insulin production and/or release was
responsible for all diagnosed diabetes mellitus.

Consequently, insulin replacement became the treat -
ment of choice for this disease.

With time, however, a more prevalent pathophysiological process
behind diabetes was uncovered.

Rather than a dearth of circulating insulin being primarily responsi -
ble for most cases of hyperglycemia, it was found that peripheral tissues, including fat and muscle, do
not respond appropriately to adequate or even high levels of circulating insulin.45,46 When circulating
glucose levels rise into a range considered “diabetic,” medical researchers characterized this more
prevalent form of persistent hyperglycemia as T2D to distinguish it from the originally described
type 1 diabetes caused by insufficient circulating insulin.47–50 The lack of proper response on the part
of peripheral tissues and organs came to be termed “IR.” In the initial course, a mild degree of IR
may not produce the markedly elevated circulating concentrations of glucose necessary for a diag -
nosis of T2D.51–53 However, the glucose–insulin disturbance during this period is still harmful and
is associated with the eventual development of many cardiovascular risks.52,53 Most experts believe
that this “prediabetic” stage is the best moment in time for instituting prevention/treatment.

Suffice it
to say that while IR is a major component in the development of T2D, it also has been linked to the
pathophysiology of the components that constitute the MS.51–55 For the purpose of this review, it is not
necessary to decide conclusively whether IR is the underlying driver of MS or merely a component.

During the First World War, the incidence of diabetes mellitus and arteriosclerotic heart disease
dramatically decreased in countries where the food supply was inadequate.

Paton56 attributed this
to a lack of dietary sugar.

However, Aschoff favored an alternative hypothesis.57 He believed that
low fat availability rather than low sugar availability during the war was the primary reason behind
diminution of cardiovascular disorders.

Subsequently, Himsworth preferred the latter assumption,58
whereas Yudkin favored the Paton proposal.59 Hence, two different points of view arose as to which
was the more important factor.

Data from the Second World War failed to solve the debate as to
whether sugars or fats were more important in the lessening of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic
heart disease because, once again, both low sugar and low fat intakes preceded the decreased occur -
rence.60 Obviously, both may have contributed, but was one a more important source?151 Potential of Diet and Dietary Supplementation
Starting in 1957, John Yudkin authored a series of articles championing the theory that con -
sumption of sugars is largely responsible for the increasing incidence of T2D and coronary heart
disease.54,61–63 To strengthen his contentions, he emphasized that the findings are clear that a higher
consumption of sucrose raises blood pressure and both circulating triglycerides and insulin levels.

In 1974, while assessing an increased incidence of hypertension in the Western world, the researcher
Ahrens reported, “the most striking recent dietary change has been the sevenfold increase in con -
sumption of sucrose.”60
By 1973, strong links between sugar intake, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease had begun to
trouble many perceptive individuals.

This prompted a select committee led by Senator George
McGovern to question whether excess intake of dietary sugars was largely responsible for the fact
that since 1970 the obesity rates had more than doubled, coinciding with a tripling incidence of
diabetes.49,64,65 In 1983, Israel et al.

stated that sensitive individuals could be adversely affected by
high levels of sucrose present in a number of modern diets.66 When 24 CHO-sensitive individuals
consumed 5%, 18%, or 33% w/w sucrose in a crossover design, diastolic blood pressure increased
with augmented sucrose intake, thus supporting Ahren’s contention that dietary sucrose plays a
major role in the increasing incidence of hypertension.60,66–68 In addition, a case was made for a
prominent role for excess sugar ingestion over the long term in the increased IR reported in the
aging process.69–71 Nevertheless, a call to decrease sucrose consumption did not occur immedi -
ately despite the evidence.

In fact, the general recommendation to the public by important health
sources was to restrict dietary saturated fats that resulted in replacement of lost calories with
refined CHO.

What is the status of sugar consumption presently?

Today, the majority of sugar calories are
derived from processed foods.

These include popular sources such as breads, cakes, jams, and ice
cream.72 Less obvious to the casual observer is the fact that sugar is present in significant amounts
in foods such as tomato sauces, salad dressings, and cereals.

Sodas and sugar-containing drinks
presently are coming under very careful scrutiny because they supply roughly one-third of calories
in the diet that are derived from added sugars.

Since 1970, it is estimated that the daily consump -
tion of calories from “sugary drinks” has at least doubled.

Two unfortunate coinciding events of
this excess are a decreased intake of micronutrients73,74 and increased body weight.75 Although the
dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 recommends that no more than 5%–15% calories should
come from solid fats and sugars combined, approximately 13% adult total calories between 2005
and 2010 came from added sugars alone.76 Matters have continued to deteriorate since that time.

Today, it is estimated that children and adolescents derive roughly 16% of their calories from added
sugars.77
CORRELATION OF FAT ACCUMULATION WITH INSULIN
RESISTANCE AND METABOLIC SYNDROME
In the not too distant past, many individuals began consuming too many calories in the form of
refined CHO.

Much of this occurred when the public was encouraged to avoid saturated fats to
prevent cardiovascular disorders, but the replacement was predominantly CHO calories that caused
more body fat accumulation along with IR as discussed in the “Historical Evidence” section .

Excess
body fat accumulation from consuming too many calories increases the probability for developing
T2D, and IR is associated with T2D14–21: more than 80% of T2D in the United States are obese, and
10% of obese patients are diabetic.78 The accumulation of mesenteric (abdominal) fat has especially
been linked to IR and various disorders associated with the MS.14,19
The prevalence of diabetes and levels of fasting glucose, insulin, c-peptide and HbA1c in the
NHANES study between 1999 and 2006 were examined across different weight classes.79 The prev -
alence of diabetes was greater in the heavier weight classes.

Consequently, it is not surprising that
losing weight is one important way to prevent, delay, and ameliorate the development of diabetes.21152 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
CARBOHYDRATES AND THEIR METABOLISM
basics
It seems reasonable in any regimen designed to prevent IR/T2D, to reduce caloric intake when over -
weight/obesity is present.

Certainly, consistent intake of too many calories from fats as well as sugars
could be responsible.

However, some have contended that there are “special calories”—those coming
from refined CHO such as sugars—that particularly need to be avoided for reasons in addition to calorie
count.70 Sweet and refined CHO have the potential to further worsen IR directly.69,70 Interestingly, the
addition of excess sugar to the diet will increase IR and systolic blood pressure in rats without increas -
ing body weight.80,81 The point to be emphasized is that reducing calories to reduce body fat is impor -
tant, but that some CHO exhibit additional factors that make their role in the MS more pronounced.

Over a span covering many years, several different research groups have consistently reported
that isocaloric consumption of sucrose compared to starch perturbs glucose tolerance.82,83 In 1978,
a review article by Yudkin published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine  stated clearly
his reasoning behind the different responses between sucrose and starch: “Present evidence sug -
gests that most of the effects of sucrose are due in small part to its ease of digestion and absorp -
tion compared with starch, also in small part to its being a disaccharide, but chiefly to the fructose
released when sucrose is digested.”84 Accordingly, Yudkin proposed over 30 years ago two impor -
tant  pathophysiological principles favored even today, namely, that the harm from caloric sweeten -
ers such as sucrose and HFCS lies in both their high glycemic indices (rapid absorption) and the
presence of fructose.84,85
glyce Mic index and load
CHO are absorbed at different rates—some relatively quickly (high glycemic index) and some rela -
tively slowly (low glycemic index).85,86 The absorption rate with consideration of the amount taken
in (glycemic load) can affect the insulin system greatly—rapidly absorbed CHO in enough quantity
are associated with IR and many chronic health maladies.85,86
CHO absorption reflects principles of structure and basic metabolism.

CHO are characteristi -
cally classified by size.87 The smallest units are monosaccharides (single units, such as glucose) and
disaccharides (two bound units, such as sucrose, composed of glucose and fructose).

These smaller
units are commonly referred to as sugars.

These smaller
units are commonly referred to as sugars.

Larger units consist of oligosaccharides (3–9 units) and
polysaccharides ( >10 units).

Starches are polysaccharides in which the polymers consisting of glu -
cose units are bound covalently either by alpha-(1,4) or alpha-(1,6) linkages.

To be absorbed, CHO must be broken down into monosaccharides.

At a minimum, two major
enzymes are involved in this process.

Alpha-amylase from saliva and pancreatic juice decom -
poses starches into monosaccharide, disaccharide, trisaccharide, and oligosaccharide units.

Alpha-
glucosidases bound in the brush border of the small intestines further divide the remaining larger
units into monosaccharides.87 To give an example, sucrose, commonly referred to as “table sugar,” is
a disaccharide of linked glucose and fructose.

Sucrase, an alpha-glucosidase, breaks down sucrose
into glucose and fructose.

Different monosaccharides are absorbed by different transport mecha -
nisms.87 As a general principal, the smaller the CHO molecule, the more rapid is the absorption
(high glycemic index).

This rapid absorption has been connected to the harm that excess sugar
intake (high glycemic load) induces.84,85
In recent decades, sucrose consumption in the United States has diminished as table sugar has
been gradually replaced by an ingredient called “high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).” The latter is a
stable product that is cheaper than sucrose.

In HFCS, the glucose and fructose are free rather than
bound, as is the case for sucrose.

Two major forms of HFCS exist.

The ratio of glucose to fructose
is either 42:53 or 55:42, not the 50:50 ratio seen with sucrose.

Suffice it to say, the consumer still
receives a good supply of each monosaccharide in the switch from table sugar to HFCS, but no
sucrase activity is necessary for absorption of the latter.

Both substances exhibit a high glycemic 153 Potential of Diet and Dietary Supplementation
index and, because the population favors their consumption, dietary sucrose and HFCS typically
provide a high glycemic load, as well.

The presence of viscous fiber slows down absorption of sugars.

This is one reason that it is unfor -
tunate that the typical Western diet is low in fiber, yet high in rapidly absorbable sugars.

Drugs such
as acarbose and natural supplements like L-arabinose restrain the activity of alpha-  glucosidases—
sucrase being an example.

Other natural products, such as bean and hibiscus extracts, also can effec -
tively slow down CHO absorption via inhibition of alpha-amylase activity.

Thus, there are a number
of means by which to slow the absorption of CHO via inhibition of enzymes involved in digestion.88
Much of the information about the role of excess sugar consumption in many metabolic pertur -
bations has been derived from animal studies.

Since the late 1970s, our laboratory has consistently
added sucrose to regular rodent feed to bring out various aspects of the MS, such as IR and hyper -
tension, that are in turn associated with disturbances in the glucose–insulin, renin–angiotensin, and
nitric oxide systems.80,81,89,90 Most of our findings from earlier animal studies have been confirmed
in clinical investigations.

For example, after 30 years, the conclusion derived from rat studies that
a heavy ingestion of sucrose and fructose elevates blood pressure has been born out in clinical
studies.80,91 It is important to repeat that in animal models, however, body weight increases have not
been a key factor in the development of these disorders, including IR.80,81,89,90 Rather, this speaks to
hormonal disturbances not directly linked to an accumulation of fat mass, but, instead, via the direct
influences of excess sugar intake.

Fructose
Various findings have suggested that excess dietary fructose, in particular, is associated with numer -
ous health problems.

Fructose
Various findings have suggested that excess dietary fructose, in particular, is associated with numer -
ous health problems.

Hepatic metabolism of fructose favors de novo  lipogenesis, and subsequent
hepatic steatosis has been connected to many aspects of IR and the MS.92–96 Other data suggest
that excess fructose consumption from high sugar consumption can play a role in heart failure.97–99
In addition, the unique ability of fructose intake to increase uric acid levels has been proposed as
a major mechanism through which fructose produces cardiorenal disease100,101 and elevates blood
pressure.100,102 Sucrose ingestion is associated with retinal capillary damage,103–105 and the fructose
moiety appears to be the culprit.106–108 Fructose has been linked to obesity.

It is reported that bev -
erages high in fructose produce smaller increases in satiety hormones and feelings of satiety than
drinks sweetened with comparable amounts of glucose.109 To add insult to injury, fructose consump -
tion may exacerbate diverse abnormalities already present in obese subjects.109
It is generally accepted that over the last few years there has been an increased consumption
of soft drinks as well as breakfast cereals, deserts, and baked goods sweetened with sucrose and
HFCS.110 Countries with a higher availability of HFCS also have a higher prevalence of T2D
independent of obesity.111,112 It is important to note that individuals on average obtain even more
fructose (about 10%) on average from HFCS (containing 55% fructose) than that from sucrose.112
Accordingly, fructose consumption makes up a significant proportion of all energy intake in the
American diet.

The bottom line is that in recent decades the upsurge in fructose consumption cor -
responds chronologically with the increased prevalence of obesity and diabetes.

Fructose does not initially stimulate insulin secretion nor enhance leptin production—important
afferent signals regulating food intake and body weight.

Thus, there is less insulin response com -
pared to glucose intake with fructose ingestion.93 As a result of lesser insulin response to meals,
circulating leptin levels are also decreased because insulin has a significant role in leptin produc -
tion.93,96,100 These actions may have deleterious long-term effects on the regulation of energy intake
and body adiposity that depend on these two hormones to quell appetite when appropriate.

In addi -
tion, fructose interferes with the normal transport of and signaling by leptin.

Overconsumption of
fructose has been reported to lead to leptin resistance, and leptin resistance has been shown to cause
excess weight gain in rats when combined with a high-fat, high-calorie diet.113 Leptin produces sati -
ety and reduces dopamine signaling, hence decreases the pleasure derived from food.114 Although 154 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
fructose alone does not in the beginning augment circulating insulin concentrations, subsequent
development of IR will eventually give rise to hyperinsulinemia.

Sources of fructose such as sucrose and HFCS are linked to numerous chronic conditions other
than obesity.100 In rodents, fructose consumption induces elevated systolic blood pressure, IR,
impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia.115–119 In monkeys, fruc -
tose rapidly causes liver damage that relates to the duration of fructose consumption and total calo -
ries consumed.120 Similar data obtained from humans are not readily available.

The implication that fructose is significantly involved in “sugar-induced chronic diseases” is not
unanimously acknowledged.

The implication that fructose is significantly involved in “sugar-induced chronic diseases” is not
unanimously acknowledged.

Sievenpiper discussed a series of his investigations in which fructose
substituted for other CHO to maintain the isocaloric state and did not find that fructose caused
pathology, i.e., substitution of fructose for other sources of CHO did not increase body weight,
circulating lipids, blood pressure, uric acid, and even improved glycemic control.121 More precisely,
this group did not find evidence that supports the proposition that fructose is harmful at typical
intakes.

“High levels of exposure and excess energy appear to be the dominant considerations for
harm.” These investigators, however, did mention that larger, longer, and higher quality studies are
needed.

Moreover, if one mechanism of dysfunction introduced by high fructose intake is lessened
regulatory control over consumption, relatively short-term tests performed under isocaloric condi -
tions likely obscure the actions of fructose in an unregulated diet.

SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES
Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) such as soft drinks and fruit juices are significant sources of sug -
ars in the American diet.111,122 In addition to supplying excess calories leading to body-fat accumulation
associated with IR, SSBs also make available those rapidly absorbed sugars (sucrose and/or HFCS)
that directly encourage development of IR/T2D.123 Numerous recent studies performed in various set -
tings have shown in both adults and children that the rising level of obesity and T2D has paralleled
a concomitant rise in the consumption of SSBs.92,124,125 Three supporting examples are given below.

In 51,603 females from the Nurses’ Health Care Study, higher consumption of SSBs was associated
with a greater degree of weight gain and greater risk for developing diabetes.126 Differently, diet sodas
were not linked to an augmented risk of diabetes.

The authors hypothesized that augmented weight
gain from excess calories and the large amount of absorbable sugars in SSBs was mainly responsible
despite the fact that other influences could have contributed, such as less physically activity, smoking,
and more alcohol intake.

This investigation brought up an intriguing question.

Do liquid sources of
sugars differ from solid sources?

A suggestion was made that sugar-sweetened soft drinks and fruit
punches caused low satiety and did relatively little to lessen caloric intake from solid foods.127–129
In a different report examining 43,960 African–American women, researchers evaluated the risk of
developing T2D in individuals who provided a comprehensive dietary history and weight information
and were free of diabetes at the beginning of the investigation.130 An important finding was that the
development of diabetes was more prevalent in those with the greater intake of both sugar-sweetened
soft drinks and fruit drinks.

It appeared that perturbations were mediated mainly through increased
body mass index (BMI).

Similarly to the study performed on nurses,126 the consumption of “straight”
orange and grapefruit juices and diet soda did not increase the rate of developing diabetes as did the
sugar-sweetened products.

In yet another study, Duffey et  al.

examined data obtained from 2,774
adults in the CARDIA study over 7 years and found that SSB consumption was associated with higher
waist circumference, and increased LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as blood pressure.131
ROLE OF LOW CARBOHYDRATE DIETS IN PREVENTING
VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF METABOLIC SYNDROME
One way to determine the effects of rapidly absorbed sugars and the relationship of the consump -
tion of refined CHO to the MS is to make these items components of the diet.80 The past several 155 Potential of Diet and Dietary Supplementation
decades in the United States might be characterized as a great, uncontrolled experiment in just this
type of dietary intervention.

Contrarily, the effects of simple CHO can be explored by testing diets
that are the reverse of the currently popular one, which is to say, by testing diets that are “low” in
CHO rather than “high” in CHO.132,133
In 2003, 132 severely obese subjects (mean BMI 43) with a proclivity for diabetes (39%) were
given either a CHO-restricted diet (low-carb) or a calorie- and fat-restricted diet (low-fat).134 After 6
months, the low-carb group as compared to the low-fat group had lost statistically significantly more
weight; mean –5.8 kg vs. –1.9 kg ( p = .002).

Greater improvements in insulin sensitivity and circulat -
ing triglyceride levels were found in the low-carb group even after adjustment for weight loss.

A fol -
low-up report in 2004 based on results after 1 year revealed a mean decrease in body weight that did
not prove to be statistically significantly different this time, mean –5.1 vs. –3.1 kg.135 Nevertheless,
in the same study, hemoglobin A1C and triglyceride levels improved more in the low-carb group.

The dropout rate was high (34%), leading the investigators to report suboptimal dietary adherence.

Other studies have confirmed various findings from the 2003 trial.

In 2005, 96 IR women with BMI
exceeding 27 kg/m2 were assigned to one of three dietary interventions: a high-CHO/high-fiber (HC)
diet, a high-fat (HF) Atkins diet, or a high-protein (HP) Zone diet.136 Body weight, waist circumference,
triglycerides, and insulin levels decreased with all diets, but with the exception of circulating insulin
levels, the changes were significantly greater in the HF and HP groups compared to the HC group.

Nordmann et al.

in 2006 examined data from five trials composed of 447 individuals with a BMI
exceeding 25 kg/m2 to compare effects of low-CHO diets without caloric restriction vs. low-fat,
caloric-restricted diets.132 By 6 months, those individuals consuming the low-CHO diets lost signifi -
cantly more scale weight than subjects following the low-fat, caloric-restricted regimens (weighted
mean difference was –3.3 kg).

However, the difference did not reach statistical significance after
12 months (weighted mean difference –1.0 kg).

Nevertheless, triglyceride and HDL changed more
favorably in the low-CHO group, whereas LDL levels were more favorable in the low-fat group.

Six randomized control trials involving 202 participants were studied to determine the effects
of low glycemic index or load diets on weight loss in overweight/obese individuals.133 Compared
to diets with a higher glycemic loads, overweight/obese subjects lost more weight and total fat
mass consuming lower glycemic loads and had more improvement in their lipid profiles.

Another
systematic review focused on data from randomized controlled trials of low-CHO diets compared
with low-fat/low-calorie ones.137 The reviewers arrived at results similar to others: low-CHO/
high-protein diets are more effective at 6 months and are as effective for up to 1 year as low-fat
diets in reducing weight and CVD.

Sacks et al.

examined the possible advantages in respect to weight loss from diets that featured
different macronutrient contents of proteins, fats, and CHO.138 A total of 811 overweight adults were
assigned to one of four diets containing different levels of the macronutrients.

All the reduced calo -
rie diets resulted in significant weight loss—it did not matter which macronutrient was emphasized
in the diet.

The objective of a recently reported study by Krebs was to assess the value of a low-CHO diet
in obese patients with T2D.139 The principal end points were insulin sensitivity, glycemic control,
and risk factors for CVD.

Measurements in 14 obese patients were made at baseline and at 12 and
24 weeks.

The diet was well tolerated, and the subjects achieved statistically significant weight
loss over 24 weeks.

The weight loss was associated with a voluntary reduction in calorie intake.

The weight loss was associated with a voluntary reduction in calorie intake.

CLINICAL STUDIES EXAMINING PREVENTION OF GLUCOSE-INSULIN
PERTURBATIONS SUCH AS IR/T2D
On the basis of the generally accepted principal that IR plays a significant role in the development
of MS, it seems reasonable that any plan for prevention would attack that perturbation.9,10 To date,
successful interventions that prevent IR/T2D have primarily included lifestyle changes such as 156 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
modification of diet and exercise.140,141 Some trials have included antidiabetic drugs to gain further
benefits.

A review of several of these studies quickly reveals overlapping elements of success.

In one trial, 41 male subjects, 47–49 years of age with early-stage T2D and 181 subjects with
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were followed to assess whether long-term, lifestyle changes
could avert diabetes.142 After 6 years, body weights were reduced 2.3%–3.7%, and 50% of patients
experienced signs of diabetic remission.

For example, blood pressure, circulating lipid levels, and
hyperinsulinemia were significantly reduced.

Because improvement in glucose tolerance correlated
with weight reduction, the clinicians concluded that chronic intervention with proper diet and exer -
cise was effective even after several years.

Results from the Da Qing IGT (impaired glucose tolerance) and Diabetes Study were reported
in 1997 based on data gathered in 1986 from 33 health-care clinics in the city of Da Qing.143 A total
of 577 subjects with IGT had been divided into four groups, i.e., control and three treatment groups.

Treatment groups comprised a diet-only group, an exercise-only group, and a diet-plus exercise
group.

The health professionals found that all three treatments compared to control led to a statisti -
cally significantly greater decrease in the development of diabetes over a 6-year period: 68% in con -
trol, 44% in diet-only, 41% in exercise-only, and 46% in diet plus exercise.

The authors concluded
that diet and exercise led to a significant decrease in the incidence of diabetes among individuals
with impaired glucose tolerance over a 6-year period that ended in 1992.

Question subsequently arose as to how long the benefits from the above study would last beyond
the period of active intervention.144 In 2006, 14 years after intervention, participants were reevalu -
ated in order to define the lasting effects of the earlier intervention.

Whereas the average annual
incidence of diabetes was 7% for the intervention group, it was 11% for the control.

Participants in
the intervention group continued for an average of 3.6 fewer years without diabetes compared to
control.

A change in cardiovascular status could not be determined.

In 2001, Tuomilehto et al.

arbitrarily allocated 172 male and 350 female subjects with reduced
glucose tolerance (IGT), mean age of 55 years and a mean BMI of 31, to either an intervention
or control group.145 The intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing
weight, intake of total fat, and saturated fat while increasing the intake of fiber and physical activ -
ity.

An oral glucose tolerance test was performed annually during a 3.2-year duration of follow-up.

Weight loss after 1 and 2 years was 4.2% and 3.5% in the intervention group as compared to 0.8%
and 0.8%, respectively, in the control group ( p < .001 for both periods).

The rate of diabetes aver -

The rate of diabetes aver -
aged 11% in the intervention group and 23% in control by the end of study ( p < .001).

Four years
after the end of study, the participants who remained free of diabetes were followed another 3 years
after discontinuation of active counseling for a total study time of 7 years.146 The occurrence of
T2D was 4.3% and 7.4%, respectively, in the intervention and control groups.

Thus, sustained good
lifestyle practices leading to a reduction in disease incidence continued to be practiced even after
active counseling was discontinued.

Added drug interventions have been tested similarly to diet and exercise interventions alone
to determine if such regimens can yield benefits in the form of reduced incidence of diabetes.

Chiasson et al.

randomly assigned patients with impaired glucose tolerance to receive 100 mg acar -
bose ( n = 714) or placebo ( n = 715) three times daily.26 Acarbose, an antidiabetic agent in common
use, decreases the absorption of CHO in the small intestines.

A total of 221 (32%) patients receiving
acarbose and 285 (42%) in the placebo group eventually developed diabetes.

At the end of protocol,
treatment with placebo for 3 months was followed by an increased conversion of impaired glucose
tolerance to diabetes.

The most frequent side effects with acarbose were flatulence and diarrhea.

The
authors concluded that taking acarbose could delay T2D in those with impaired glucose tolerance.

In the so-called TRIPOD study (Troglitazone in Prevention of Diabetes), Buchanan et al.

random -
ized women with gestational diabetes to the insulin sensitizer troglitazone (400 mg/day) ( n = 133)
or to placebo ( n = 133).27 During a follow-up of 30 months, the average incidence rate for T2D
was 5.4% in the troglitazone treatment group compared to 12.1% in the placebo group ( p <  .01).

Accordingly, treating women with troglitazone was deemed to delay and perhaps prevent the onset 157 Potential of Diet and Dietary Supplementation
of T2D.

Women who completed the TRIPOD study were offered participation in the PIPOD study
(Pioglitazone in the Prevention of Diabetes).28 The risk of diabetes found at 4.6% per year in PIPOD
was similar to that found in those taking troglitazone in TRIPOD.

The conclusion from both stud -
ies was that thiazolidinedione drugs could favorably delay the onset of diabetes in Hispanic women
with prior gestational diabetes.

The hypothesis of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study published in 2002 was that a life -
style intervention program that incorporated lowering elevated glucose levels, reducing overweight,
living a more active lifestyle, or taking the antidiabetic drug metformin would ameliorate the severity
of, delay the onset of, and/or avert diabetes.29 The investigators assigned 3234 nondiabetic subjects
with elevated fasting blood glucose, mean age 51 years, and mean BMI 34.0 to three groups: a placebo
group, a metformin group (850 mg twice daily), or a lifestyle modification program that had a 7%
weight loss target and a minimum of 150 minutes of exercise per week as goals.

The incidence of dia -
betes was 11.0%, 7.8%, and 4.8%, respectively, after a mean 2.8-year follow-up.

The results suggested
that persons at risk for diabetes might avoid or delay onset of diabetes by reducing modest amounts of
excess weight through diet and exercise.

The group participants in the lifestyle intervention decreased
risk of developing diabetes by 58%.

The lifestyle intervention regimen proved statistically signifi -
cantly more effective than use of metformin.

Nevertheless, metformin use proved effective compared
to placebo.

Of note, although lifestyle intervention was helpful for all age groups, metformin therapy
became less so with age—being no different than placebo in patients over the age of 60.

Troglitazone was used initially in a separate grouping in the DPP study described earlier.

Troglitazone was used initially in a separate grouping in the DPP study described earlier.

However, it was discontinued later when the drug was shown to be hepatotoxic.29 An article pub -
lished in 2005 evaluated both the short-term results while the trial was active and the long-term
results after troglitazone use was discontinued with the other trial groups.30 The troglitazone group
ceased functioning after a mean of 0.9 years: at that time, the diabetes incident rate was 3.0 cases per
100 patient-years compared to 12.0 (placebo), 6.7 (metformin), and 5.1 (intensive lifestyle interven -
tion) cases per 100 person-years in the other three groups.

However, 3 years later after troglitazone
withdrawal, the incidence rate for diabetes was no different than the placebo group.

Therefore,
troglitazone appeared effective only during the shortened period of actual use.

When the DPP study was completed, 88% of the enrolled patients entered a 10-year follow-up
phase.31 In this phase, all three groups (placebo, lifestyle intervention, and metformin) were now
offered only lifestyle intervention.

At the end of the study, diabetes incidence rates were similar
between groups—(5.9/100 person-years for the original lifestyle group, 4.9 for the metformin group,
and 5.6 for the placebo group).

The investigators believed based on the original numbers for the pla -
cebo group the findings implied that prevention or delay of diabetes through lifestyle intervention
could persist for at least 10 years.

Torgerson et al.

in 2004 reasoned that addition of a weight-loss drug (Orlistat) to a lifestyle regi -
men change would be even more effective than a lifestyle change alone.32 This postulate was based
on the close link between obesity and T2D.

A total of 3305 subjects were assigned to a lifestyle
regimen change plus either Orlistat 120 mg or placebo three times daily.

In a 4-year double blind
prospective study, participants were required to have a BMI exceeding 30 kg/m2.

In an assess -
ment of glucose tolerance among the subjects, 79% were normal and 21% showed impaired glucose
tolerance.

Unfortunately, the dropout figures were large—only 52% of the Orlistat-treated group
and 34% of the placebo group completed the 4-year study.

The cumulative incidence of diabe -
tes was 9.0% in the placebo group and 6.2% in those taking Orlistat.

Average weight loss in the
treated group, which was comparable in both the impaired and normal glucose tolerance subgroups,
exceeded that of the placebo group—5.8 vs. 3.0 kg ( p < .001).

Of note, only subjects with impaired
glucose tolerance showed greater diabetes prevention relative to placebo.

The investigators con -
cluded that Orlistat contributed to diabetes prevention in a setting of lifestyle change.

Kosaka et al.

in 2005 examined whether a concentrated lifestyle intervention that attempts to
achieve and maintain ideal body weight would be beneficial in subjects with impaired glucose
tolerance.147 The intensive intervention group contained 102 individuals, whereas the control group 158 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
consisted of 356 individuals.

Control subjects were urged to maintain a BMI < 24.0 kg/m2 and
the intervention subjects were urged to maintain a BMI < 22.0 kg/m2.

Importantly, the cumulative
4-year incidence of diabetes in the control group was 9.3% compared to 3.0% in the intervention
group ( p < .001).

The trial was associated with body weight decrease of 0.39 kg in control compared
to 2.18 kg in the intervention group ( p < .001).

This study provides evidence that lifestyle interven -
tion aimed at achieving ideal body weight in men with impaired glucose tolerance can be successful.

This study provides evidence that lifestyle interven -
tion aimed at achieving ideal body weight in men with impaired glucose tolerance can be successful.

In 2006, Gerstein et al.

designed a study to determine the ability of rosiglitazone to prevent
T2D in individuals at high risk of developing this entity .33 The subjects were aged 30 years or more
and had impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance or both.

The subjects, who up to
the initiation of the study were without evidence of CVD, were assigned to receive rosiglitazone
(8 mg daily) or placebo for a median of 3 years.

End points were the development of diabetes or
death.

11.6% subjects receiving rosiglitazone in contrast to 26.0% given placebo developed diabetes.

About 50.5% of treated subjects and 30.3% receiving placebo eventually became normoglycemic
(p < .001).

Cardiovascular event rates were the same in both groups, although congestive heart
failure (0.5% compared to 0.1%) may have been greater in the rosiglitazone group.

Therefore,
rosiglitazone was effective in preventing T2D under the conditions of study.

In a 2009 article, Kawamori et al.

examined high-risk Japanese patients eating standard diets,
taking regular exercise, and exhibiting impaired glucose tolerance.34 Subjects were randomly
assigned to placebo ( n = 883) or oral voglibose, a CHO inhibitor similar to acarbose, 0.2 mg three
times a day ( n = 897).

Subjects in the voglibose group had a lower risk of progression to diabetes
compared to placebo (50 vs. 106) ( p < .0014).

The conclusion was that voglibose is able to help
prevent diabetes.

DeFronzo et  al.

frequently assessed 602 patients who received pioglitazone or placebo for a
medium follow up of 2.4 years.35 As compared to placebo, pioglitazone reduced the risk for conver -
sion of impaired glucose tolerance to T2D by 72%.

Other benefits included a reduced rate of carotid
intimal thickening, a lowered diastolic blood pressure, and an increased level of HDL.

However,
pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain, increased plasma volume, and edema.

McCowen and Fajtova, in a letter to the editor that followed, noted the parallel rise in HbA1c
between the placebo and pioglitazone groups once the drug was stopped and suggested that the drug
only had short-term effects.148 In other words, evidence that prevention remained after stopping the
drug was weak.

The foregoing studies were designed to assess ways to avoid or at least ameliorate the ramifi -
cations of IR/T2D and to some extent overweight/obesity.

Many consider these entities to be the
driving forces behind many important aspects of the MS.10 The regimens to date include lifestyle
changes such as modification of diet and exercise as well as use of antidiabetic drugs.

The success
in one study using Orlistat was attributed to weight loss.

With the development of various classes
of antidiabetic agents, it commonly has been hypothesized that each one could be used early on to
prevent development of further glucose-insulin perturbations.

In the above studies, metformin, thia -
zolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors were all associated with favorable effects over the
period of use.

However, the benefits derived from drugs seemed to dissipate once they were stopped.

Also, it is unclear as to at what length of intervention brings out side effects, such as the weight gain
associated with pioglitazone and related drugs.

DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS TO PREVENT AND/OR AMELIORATE
THE MS: THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL
PersPective
As discussed earlier, in addition to lifestyle intervention alone, drugs have been used along with
lifestyle changes in various research protocols designed to examine IR/T2D prevention.26–35 159 Potential of Diet and Dietary Supplementation
However, many believe that overcoming glucose–insulin perturbations would also benefit other
components of the MS.9,10,13 Although inclusion of drugs in the various regimens appears to have
some added merit, by and large, their removal eventually causes loss of prior positive gains.148
Nevertheless, there is obviously hesitancy to use drug therapy over the long term to prevent or
lessen manifestations of IR/T2D.26–35 No doubt the major fear leading to avoidance of prolonged
drug use is the potential for adverse reactions.149,150
In contrast to drugs, natural dietary substances with a long history of safety have not been used
extensively in major clinical studies despite their potential to overcome IR, promote weight loss,
lower elevated blood pressure, and produce a more healthful lipid profile (see Table 7.2).

As a general
rule, natural dietary supplements compared to drugs are less potent, but also have fewer and less
severe adverse reactions.

The major reasons behind the paucity of cogent clinical research performed
on natural dietary supplements compared to drugs are simple.

For one, the typical manufacturer of

In addition, difficulties in patenting natural substances play a role.

Major antidiabetic drugs can be classified as insulin stimulators that increase production
and release of insulin (sulfonylureas and meglitinides), compounds that block the gastrointesti -
nal  absorption of CHO (acarbose, voglibose), remedies that reduce hepatic glucose production
(biguanides), and preparations that improve insulin action peripherally (thiazolidinediones and
biguanides).36,37,149,150 In many instances, the natural dietary supplements that have a beneficial effect
on glucose-insulin metabolism do so via multiple mechanisms.

For instance, both the (–)-hydroxy -
citric acid in Garcinia cambogia  and the chlorogenic acids in green coffee bean extract help to regu -
late varying degrees of CHO digestion and absorption, liver gluconeogenesis, and insulin sensitivity
as well as other mechanisms.151 Despite all difficulties, we will attempt to compare the working of
natural dietary supplements with drugs used to treat IR/T2D.

As a first approximation, attempts to classify natural supplements in the same manner as
drugs might look like this: compounds that augment insulin production and/or release ( Gymnema
sylvestre , fenugreek, garlic)152,153; ingredients that beneficially decrease and delay gut absorption of
CHO (soluble fibers and carb blockers such as bean extract and L-arabinose)88,154,155; substances that
reduce hepatic glucose production (biotin)156; and items that improve insulin action peripherally
(trivalent chromium, cinnamon, maitake mushroom SX fraction, and bitter melon).157–161
We will highlight only a few of the most popular natural supplements below such as soluble
fibers, white bean extract, and L arabinose that lessen CHO absorption in the small intestines and
thus lower the glycemic index like acarbose88; biotin that can lessen hepatic glucose formation and
release like metformin,156 trivalent chromium that is basically an insulin sensitizer such as thiazoli -
denediones,157 and Garcinia cambogia  that is among other things an appetite suppressor and can
decrease fat accumulation and thus obviate IR.151TABLE 7.2 (Continued  )

NATURAL MEANS TO BENEFICIALLY INFLUENCE
CARBOHYDRATE GUT ABSORPTION
Overview:  Accepting that diets high in sugars and other refined CHO are major factors in the
various pathologies of the MS such as IR/T2D, overweight/obesity, and other contributing entities
comprising the MS,9,10 the most direct form of therapy would be simply to reduce the oral intake
of sugars, especially fructose, and/or slow their absorption to lower the glycemic index and load.

Benefits realized from reducing dietary intake via low CHO diets have been summarized
earlier.132–139,162–165 Nevertheless, many individuals are not prepared to adopt such necessary dietary
changes.

Issues ranging from advisability of replacing CHO with fats to the palatability of CHO-
depleted meals have led to hesitancy.

Nevertheless, the ongoing emergence of data strengthening the
positive correlation between excess intake of rapidly absorbed CHO such as fructose, glucose, and
sucrose with obesity has challenged many nutritionists to seek more practical means to duplicate
results found with the rigorous removal of refined CHO from the diet.

Two general approaches com -
monly are suggested to help overcome this challenge.

First, more fiber can be added to the diet to
take advantage of the findings that various viscous fibers slow CHO absorption and have beneficial
effects on weight loss.166–168 Second, enzymes necessary for CHO absorption, such as amylase and
sucrase, can be inhibited to reduce the rate of gastrointestinal processing of CHO.88,169
Fiber intake:  If a reasonable portion of CHO will remain in the diet of many for the sake of
palatability and reducing fat intake, the addition of soluble, viscous fibers can still provide some
therapeutic relief, because soluble fibers slow the absorption of refined CHO.

Nutritionists long have
implored the public to eat more dietary fiber, especially soluble fiber.170,171 In carefully controlled
animal studies, the ability of soluble fiber to delay sugar absorption is associated with the lowering
of elevated blood pressures, a major cardiovascular risk factor.172,173 Unfortunately, the general pub -
lic has significantly resisted increasing dietary fiber intake, probably for taste reasons and because
of perturbations created in the gastrointestinal tract—gas, cramps, and frequent bowel movements.

Carbohydrate blockers:  Many preparations have been developed to block major enzymes involved
in CHO digestion and absorption, including alpha -amylase and glucosidase.88,169 Two of the most
popular and well-studied such compounds are a bean extract to primarily inhibit alpha -amylase
and L-arabinose to inhibit sucrase.

The discussion on CHO blockers in the “Specific Carbohydrate
Blockers” section will  focus on these two preparations.

Using effective inhibitors of digestive
enzymes involved in CHO absorption would allow an individual to maintain a more reasonable
dietary proportion of CHO while lessening or at least slowing absorption of sugars and refined CHO
with relatively high glycemic indices.

For decades, it has been recognized that extracts from certain
beans inhibit alpha -amylase activity.88,169,174–176 In addition to the potential to lower caloric intake
and prevent IR secondary to rapid CHO absorption, the ability to convert some CHO into resistant
starches that are subsequently fermented in the large bowel is another advantage of CHO blockers.177
Resistant starches:  Starches that escape enzymatic digestion in the small intestines and pass
into the large bowel are characteristically referred to as “resistant starches.” A good estimate is that
under usual circumstances 10% of consumed starches pass through the gastrointestinal tract undi -
gested.178 There are many reasons for nondigestion.

Starches located in the cell walls of plants may
not be available for enzymatic action.

Also, because of crystalline structure and size, raw starch
granules are often unavailable.

Some fibers such as cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectins, mucilages,
and gums escape digestion, because humans lack the necessary enzymes.

An important aspect of
resistant starches is that after passage into the colon, they can be fermented into short-chain fatty
acids, organic acids, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.177 The fermented, undigested starches are asso -
ciated with weight loss, improved blood lipid status, better glycemic control, and improved antioxi -
dant protection.85,179–181162 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine

Many excellent reviews detail early work carried out in the 1970s and 1980s on bean extract inhibi -
tors.88,174,175,182,183 A number of crude bean amylase inhibitors were marketed as “carb blockers” in
the early 1980s.

However, early clinical trials designed to show efficacy were generally disappoint -
ing.184–186 As a result, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suspended sales of the products in
1982.

Subsequently, Layer et al.

pointed out that many preparations examined earlier showed insuf -
ficient antiamylase activity, which explains the failures of these early trials.187 With the development
of better preparations having greater capability to inhibit amylase, later clinical studies began to
report more promise.188–192
The most popular current bean preparation is a water extract of the white kidney bean—
Phaseolus vulgaris .

The extract has been shown to be relatively free of toxic metabolites and safe
for human consumption.184 Animal studies (rats and pigs) on the more recent bean extract pro -
vided the initial indication that it would be a clinically useful tool to inhibit starch absorption in
vivo.193–196 In both acute and subchronic studies on rats, Preuss et al.

examined the capability of
Phaseolus  vulgaris  and other CHO blockers to inhibit the absorption of rice starch and sucrose.195,196
To estimate CHO absorption, groups of rats were fed with water or water plus rice starch and/or
sucrose; circulating glucose subsequently was measured at timed intervals.

After the ingestion of
bean extract, glucose elevations above baseline over the 4 hours following a rice starch challenge
as estimated by area-under-curve (AUC) were 40% of that of the internal control.195 Unexpectedly,
bean extract also inhibited sucrose absorption.

In contrast, although L-arabinose effectively blocked
sucrose absorption, it did not influence rice starch absorption.

Giving either natural inhibitor with -
out a CHO challenge led to no significant changes in circulating glucose concentrations.

This sug -
gests no major effects on overall metabolism from the bean extract and confirms that the lowered
circulating glucose levels were secondary to blocked absorption.

A subchronic study was undertaken to determine whether inhibitors of gastrointestinal starch
and sucrose absorption remained effective with continued use.

As a secondary gain, metabolic
influences after prolonged intake were examined.196 Rats were intubated twice daily over 9 weeks
with either water or an equal volume of water containing a formula that comprised both the bean
extract and L-arabinose.

No toxic effects (hepatic, renal, hematologic) were evident.

Blood chemis -
tries revealed significantly lower circulating glucose levels and a trend toward decreased HbA1C in
the nondiabetic rats receiving the carb blockers compared to control.

Subchronic administration of
enzyme inhibitors was also linked to many metabolic changes that included lowered systolic blood
pressure and altered fluid-electrolyte balance.

Vinson et al.

carried out two single-dose human studies with the primary purpose of determining
whether bean extract inhibited human CHO absorption.197 In the first, they challenged eleven fasting
subjects with white bread and margarine with and without 1.5 g bean extract.

In estimating AUC,
the investigators found that glucose absorption was decreased by 66%.

In the second full-meal
study, this time performed with seven subjects who received 0.75 g bean extract, the trend again was
inhibited absorption as indicated by a 28%–41% diminution in CHO uptake.

Thom, in 2000, published results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial per -
formed in Norway that utilized a test product containing white kidney bean extract, inulin, chicory
root, and Garcinia cambogia .198 Forty healthy, overweight subjects with a BMI between 27.5 and 39
took two tablets of the test product before all meals for 12 weeks.

Subjects were also instructed to follow
a 1200 kcal low-fat diet.

After 12 weeks, the active group lost an average of 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) ( p = .001),
whereas the placebo group lost 1.3 kg (2.86 lb) ( p > .05).

Between-group statistical  differences were
not calculated.

Percent body fat (as measured by bioelectrical impedance) decreased by 2.3% ( p = .01)
in the active group in contrast to 0.7% ( p > .05) in the placebo.

Percent body fat (as measured by bioelectrical impedance) decreased by 2.3% ( p = .01)
in the active group in contrast to 0.7% ( p > .05) in the placebo.

No adverse events were reported.

A study performed by Celleno et al.

in Italy utilized a bean extract for weight reduction.199 In a
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial consisting of a 30-day run-in phase 163 Potential of Diet and Dietary Supplementation
followed by a 30-day active phase, 60 subjects between ages 20 and 45 were chosen.

Subjects were
5–15 kg overweight, but their weight had been stable during the preceding 6 months.

Through the
run-in phase, subjects were educated on the importance of maintaining a test diet that included a
2000- to 2200-calorie diet with complex CHO intake concentrated in one of the two daily meals.

Subjects were given either 450 mg of bean extract or placebo before the main CHO-containing meal
of the day.

Considering the major end point, the active group lost an average of 2.93 kg (6.45 lb) in
30 days compared with an average of 0.35 kg (0.77 lb) in the placebo group ( p < .001).

The active
group demonstrated a 10.45% reduction in body fat compared with a 0.16% reduction in the placebo
group ( p < .001).

Waist and hip circumferences in the test group showed 2.93 and 1.48 cm reduc -
tions, respectively, compared with 0.46 and 0.11 cm reductions in the placebo group ( p < .001).

No
adverse events were reported.

In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study performed by the Udani group, 39
obese subjects (BMI 30–43) received either 1500 mg of bean extract or placebo.200 Twenty-seven
subjects completed the study.

The pills were taken with at least 8 oz of water daily with lunch and
dinner for 8 weeks.

The treatment group lost an average of 3.79 lb compared with the placebo group
that lost an average of 1.65 lb ( p = .35).

Triglyceride levels in the treatment group were reduced by
an average of 26.3 mg/dL compared to the 8.2 mg/dL in the placebo group ( p = .07).

Energy level
(as measured by a 10-point Likert scale) demonstrated a 14% increase in the treatment group in
contrast to a 1% decrease in the placebo group.

However, this difference did not approach statistical
significance ( p > .05).

No significant adverse events were associated with the active product.

Roughly 3 years later, Udani and Singh carried out a separate 4-week, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study involving 25 healthy subjects consuming 1000 mg of proprietary fraction -
ated white bean extract or an identical placebo twice a day before meals.201 Both active and control
group lost weight and waist inches—active group, –6.0 lb ( p = .0002) and –2.2 in ( p = .0050) and
the placebo group –4.7 lb ( p = .0016) and –2.1 in ( p = .0001).

There was no statistical difference
in these parameters between the two groups.

When the subjects were stratified by total dietary
CHO intake, comparing the tertiles consuming the most CHO did show statistically significant
differences between the active and placebo groups (body weight –8.7 vs. –1.7 lb, p = .04 and waist
circumference –3.3 vs. –1.3 inches, p = .01).

In an 8-week, open-label study performed by Koike et al.

in 10 subjects receiving white bean
extract, a 2.4% reduction in weight, a 5.9% reduction in body fat, a 5.2% reduction in waist circum -
ference, and a 2.9% reduction in hip circumference were found.202 All differences were statistically
significant and no adverse events took place.

Wu et al.

performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study on 101 volunteers
with a BMI between ages 25 and 40.203 Volunteers received either placebo or the active substance.

For 60 consecutive days, two capsules containing Phaseolus vulgaris  extract (1000 mg) or placebo
were taken 15 minutes before each meal.

Body weights, waist and hip measurements, and blood
for chemical analysis were obtained.

183,"Chunk 183:
Body weights, waist and hip measurements, and blood
for chemical analysis were obtained.

After 60 days, the 51 subjects receiving Phaseolus vulgaris
extract compared to a placebo group of 50 subjects exhibited clinical and statistically significantly
greater average reduction of body weight ( –1.9 vs. –0.4 kg [ p < .001])and waist circumference ( –1.9
vs. –0.4 cm [ p < .001]), but no difference in the changes of average hip circumference ( –0.3 vs. –0.3
cm [p = .84]).

These results indicate that Phaseolus vulgaris  extract can bring about clinically and
statistically significant decrements in body weight and waist circumference.

Examination of the safety and efficacy of Phaseolus vulgaris  extract on weight management
was carried out by Grube et al.204 Importantly, the investigation was carried out in two phases:
first, a double-blind, weight loss phase in which subjects adhered to a mildly hypocaloric diet for
12 weeks; and second, an open-label weight maintenance trial in which participants energy intake
was ad libitum over 24 weeks.

In the first phase, there were 123 subjects, ages 18–60 years with a
BMI between 25 and 35 kg/m2 assigned to a treatment and placebo group.

In the treatment group,
subjects received 1.0 g of bean extract three times a day—at mealtime, while the placebo group
received the same number of dummy pills containing inactive ingredients on the same schedule.

164 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
At the end of study (12 weeks), the treatment group lost a mean of 2.91 ± 2.63 kg in body weight
compared to 0.92 ± 2.00 kg for the placebo group ( p < .001).

Changes in impedance and waist
circumference indicated that much of the weight transformation was secondary to fat loss.

After
completion of the first phase, 49 subjects from both the active and placebo arms who had lost at
least 3% of body weight participated in the open-label 24-week extension period.

During this phase,
36 out of 49 subjects (73.5%) maintained their weight to within 1.0% of their mass at initiation of the
second phase.

No serious adverse events were noted over the entire 36 weeks of study.

As suggested above, no major adverse reactions related to Phaseolus vulgaris  extract have been
reported to date.205,206 Theoretically, gastrointestinal complaints such as gas, cramping, and so on
should accompany use, but these problems seem much less severe with natural carb blockers than
with drugs or fiber.

In some early studies, ingesting CHO blockers led to gas and bloating.

However,
Boivin reported that this could be ameliorated using lower dosing.190
Brudnak carefully examined the safety of bean extracts because kidney bean lectins can pres -
ent serious problems.176 Fortunately, the commonly used extraction process for the bean extract
employed in the clinical studies described above frees the extract of lectins.

Using the same extract,
thorough acute and subchronic laboratory studies on rats have shown no toxicity.195,196
L-Arabinose
Concerning alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, much work has been performed on L-arabinose.155,195,196
L-arabinose is a naturally occurring compound that has been shown to have specific inhibitory activity
on the digestive enzyme sucrase.207–209 The effects of sucrase inhibition have been found to be exten -
sive after sucrose challenge to rats—ranging from suppressing increases in blood glucose to thwarting
the initiation of lipogenic enzyme activity.208 A clinical study209 reported that consuming L-arabinose
caused a significant suppression of serum glucose levels after a sucrose challenge and attenuated
sucrose-induced hyperglycemia in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects when L-arabinose was ingested
in conjunction with sucrose.

It is important to realize that L-arabinose should not influence absorption
of HFCS.

HFCS, a mixture of free glucose and fructose, does not require sucrase for absorption.

It is important to realize that L-arabinose should not influence absorption
of HFCS.

HFCS, a mixture of free glucose and fructose, does not require sucrase for absorption.

Other Potential Carbohydrate Blockers
Other choices exist that influence gastrointestinal absorption of CHO via inhibition of various
digestive enzymes.

In previous rat studies, hibiscus extract proved to be as effective and as safe
as white bean extract.210–212 Although further studies are indicated, hibiscus alone or combined
with other ingredients appears to be quite effective.195,196 A stereoisomer related to hibiscus acid,
(–)-hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which commonly is extracted from Garcinia cambogia  and related
species, inhibits pancreatic alpha-amylase and intestinal alpha-  glucosidase as well as directly delay -
ing glucose uptake from the small intestine.213,214 Yet other natural compounds are known to be
active.

In 1998, Lankisch et al.

reported on the use of an amylase inhibitor extracted from wheat.215
They found that the inhibitor delayed CHO absorption and reduced peak postprandial plasma glu -
cose concentrations.

In the near future, formulas may be developed from a wide array of natural CHO blockers.

Gymnema sylvestre ,216,217 apple extract (phloridzin)218 and green coffee bean extract (chlorogenic
and related acids) have been reported to inhibit glucose transport.219 In the case of coffee extracts,
components other than chlorogenic acid per se  exhibit benefits and, at least in the liver, there may
be some benefits in relation to fructose consumption.220 Among proposed mechanisms of action,
glucose transport may be inhibited by flavonoids via effects on the Glut 2 sugar transporter.221
Fructose transport is influenced by eucalyptus leaf.222165 Potential of Diet and Dietary Supplementation
INSULIN SENSITIZERS
Trivalent Chromium
Perhaps the best-examined natural supplement, insulin sensitizer, is trivalent chromium.223–225
Nearly 60 years ago, Schwarz and Mertz discovered that an extract derived from pork kidney
restored glucose tolerance in rats226 and 2 years later reported that chromium was a major compo -
nent of the so-called glucose tolerance factor (GTF).227 Connections of GTF to human health first
arose from studies in individuals receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), a procedure at that time
in which chromium was absent in the replacement fluid.228–230 In the initial reports, patients eventu -
ally showed characteristic signs and symptoms of chromium deficiency,231 namely high circulat -
ing glucose levels, a need for insulin replacement, elevated circulating lipids, and even peripheral
neuropathy and encephalopathy that improved after trivalent chromium replacement.228–230 Largely
through the investigations of Richard Anderson at the USDA, much knowledge has been gained
concerning many aspects of chromium metabolism.225,231
Various facets of MS, particularly IR and hypertension, can be brought out in rats by addi -
tion of sucrose in diets—even at levels comparable to those consumed in the Western diet.80,108,232
Importantly, the addition of chromium can overcome these sucrose-induced conditions.

Interestingly,
in one study examining the effects of trivalent chromium on insulin sensitivity and hypertension,
although lower levels of chromium supplementation ameliorated IR and lowered the sucrose-
induced elevations of blood pressure initially, over time these effects dissipated and both parameters
returned to control baseline.232 In this case, increasing the chromium dose returned the favorable
effects.

These findings raised two possibilities that (1) it took longer to bring about sugar-induced
chromium deficiency under conditions of low but insufficient chromium intake or (2) chromium
was not working entirely through a replacement of any deficiency in body chromium and more was
needed to maintain effects.

A major difficulty with chromium replacement is bioavailability.223–225 It appears that all forms
of trivalent chromium are not equal in bioavailability according to many laboratory and clinical
studies.224,225,233,234 Initially, the most popular form of supplementation was chromium chloride, but
as early as 1989 Evans pointed out the poor absorption of chromium chloride (inorganic ligand)
when compared to chromium picolinate (organic ligand).224 The normal absorption for chromium
chloride is only 0.4%–1.0% of the oral dose.225 This fact led to the development of more bioavail -
able, organic forms of chromium, for instance, having nicotinate, picolinate, and histidinate as
ligands.224,225,233,234 Seaborn and Stoecker performed a series of studies showing the effects of CHO,
acids, and agents affecting prostaglandin metabolism to alter absorption.235–237
Although the hexavalent form of chromium is toxic, little evidence suggests the same for the tri -
valent form.223 Trivalent chromium, such as the nicotinic, picolinic, and histidinate forms, appears
to be quite safe, yet still effective.238,239 Early studies that indicated possible mutagenic effects of
chromium picolinate today seem to lack relevance240 inasmuch as further studies with both animals
and humans have failed to corroborate toxic effects.241,242
Clinical studies have supported claims of benefits from oral organic trivalent chromium
compounds.

Anderson et al.

performed the most convincing of these studies in China.157 A group
of 180 men and women with T2D were randomly divided into three groups: placebo, chromium
200 mcg daily, and chromium 1000 mcg daily.

Subjects did not change their normal medications,
eating habits, or living habits.

Those individuals in the higher chromium dose group showed the ear -
liest and greatest benefits, although the group receiving the lower dose also profited.

After 4 months,
HbA1C, fasting blood glucose, circulating insulin levels, and plasma total cholesterol levels improved
in the active arms.

Of note, the beneficial effects in the individuals with diabetes occurred at levels
of chromium exceeding the upper limit of the Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intake.

Martin et al.

examined subjects with T2D who had received glipizide and placebo for a three
month run-in period.243 For another six months, 12 continued with the sulfonylurea and placebo
regimen, whereas 17 were given 1000 mcg of chromium picolinate in addition to glipizide.

Relative 166 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
to the placebo group, subjects in the chromium group showed significant improvements in insulin
sensitivity and glucose control.

At the same time, this group displayed less body-weight gain and
visceral fat accumulation.

Accordingly, many believe that chromium supplementation could be an excellent tool to over -
come and/or ameliorate IR/T2D rather than more toxic drugs.244,245 Linday commented in 1997 on
the Diabetes Prevention Program developed to determine whether T2D can be prevented or delayed
in persons with impaired glucose tolerance.244 Noting that drugs such as metformin and troglitazone
had been used, the author questioned why trivalent chromium with its ability to ameliorate IR as
well as an acceptable adverse action profile and reasonable costs had not been included as one arm
of the study.

Preuss and Anderson came to the same conclusions regarding the use of chromium to
overcome many of the chronic conditions associated with IR.245
SUBSTANCES THAT REDUCE HEPATIC GLUCOSE PRODUCTION AND OUTPUT
Biotin: Biotin, a B vitamin, administered in high doses improves glycemic control in several ani -
mal models while showing no evidence of toxicity.246–248 In one study, 26 diabetic KK mice that
were moderately hyperglycemic and insulin resistant received saline (control) or different doses of
biotin.246 Biotin treatment, compared to control, lowered postprandial glucose levels, improved tol -
erance to glucose, and lessened IR.

In a second study, oral glucose tolerance testing was performed
in an animal model of spontaneous non-insulin-diabetes—Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty
rat.

The rats received different doses of biotin.

Biotin corrected impaired glucose tolerance, and
insulin secretion decreased leading to lower circulating insulin levels.247 In a third study carried out
in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, impaired glucose tolerance improved after intraperitoneal
biotin was given even though the poor insulin secretion did not improve.248 Relatively low glucoki -
nase and hexokinase activities were found in liver and pancreas of the diabetic rats.

However, both
liver and pancreas values increased into the normal range after the biotin application.

These results
demonstrate that injected biotin can improve glucose handling without increasing insulin secretion
in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.

Much of these findings have been duplicated in clinical studies.249,250 When people with type 1
diabetes were given 16 mg of oral biotin per day for 1 week, their fasting blood sugars dropped
by 50%.249 In a larger study, 43 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetics showed lower serum
biotin levels than 64 healthy controls.250 Serum biotin levels inversely correlated with fasting blood
sugars.

Perhaps not a surprise, 9 mg of biotin given daily corrected hyperglycemia with virtually no
change in insulin levels.

As elevated levels of pyruvate and lactate decreased into normal ranges, the
investigators postulated that biotin enhances the activity of the biotin-dependent enzyme, pyruvate
carboxylase, and is the reason behind improvement.

McCarty wrote an interesting article in the Journal Medical Hypotheses .156 On the basis of the
earlier work, he hypothesized that biotin enhances glucokinase activity, which has a key role for
normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, postprandial hepatic glucose uptake, and the appropri -
ate suppression of hepatic glucose output and gluconeogenesis by elevated plasma glucose levels.

Secondary effects on pyruvate kinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase lowered hepatic glu -
cose output.

Suffice it to say, biotin decreases hepatic glucose production and output, as the drug met -
formin.

Of interest, biguanides like metformin that have similar effects on hepatic output of glucose,
have been shown to increase longevity in rodents.251,252 Could biotin mimic this effect in humans?

HCA AND MULTIPLE MECHANISMS REGULATING GLUCOSE METABOLISM
(–)-Hydroxycitric Acid— Garcinia  spp.

Extract: (–)-Hydroxycitric acid (HCA), a naturally occur -
ring substance found chiefly in fruits of the species of Garcinia , is a totally unexpected regulator
of multiple pathways that influence glucose uptake and metabolism.

Indeed, for 30 years after its 167 Potential of Diet and Dietary Supplementation
discovery, it was universally considered to be a source of gluconeogenesis that, at best, would exer -
cise no impact on blood glucose and insulin levels and, at worst, would seriously elevate serum glu -
cose in diabetics.

It and several synthetic derivatives of citric acid have been investigated extensively
in regard to their ability to inhibit the production of fatty acids from CHO, to suppress appetite, and
to inhibit weight gain.253 Weight-loss benefits were first ascribed to HCA, its salts, and its lactone in
United States Patent 3,764,692 granted to John M. Lowenstein in 1973 .

The proposed mechanisms of action for HCA, most of which were originally put forth by
researchers at the pharmaceutical firm of Hoffmann-La Roche, have been summarized in numerous
publications since that time.

The primary mechanism according to general agreement in the field is
HCA’s reduction of the conversion of CHO calories into fats by competitively inhibiting the actions
of adenosine 5 ʹ-triphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase, the enzyme that catalyzes the extramitochondrial
cleavage of citrate to oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA.

ATP citrate lyase is the enzyme that initiates the
conversion of citrate into fatty acids and cholesterol in the primary pathway of fatty acid synthesis in
the body254 HCA increases the production and storage of glycogen (which is found in the liver, small
intestine, and muscles of mammals) while reducing both appetite and weight gain.255
HCA serves to disinhibit fatty acid oxidation.

The compound malonyl CoA, which is activated as
the first committed step in the biosynthesis of fatty acids in the body, also is a negative regulator of
fatty acid metabolism for energy.

In other words, if the body is synthesizing fatty acids from carbo -
hydrates at the same time, it is inhibiting the oxidation of fats for energy.

The prevalent orthodoxy
in the end of the 1990s was that HCA acts to unleash fatty acid oxidation by negating the effects of
malonyl CoA while promoting gluconeogenesis.256
Quite surprisingly, a beneficial effect of HCA on blood sugar regulation was never suggested
in the early literature on the topic and only was discovered in 2000.

The original pharmaceutical
research on HCA performed at Hoffman-La Roche failed to find significant changes in either blood
glucose levels or blood insulin levels, undoubtedly in part due to the fact that almost all of that
research used diets that consisted largely of glucose (e.g., 70% glucose diets were typically employed
to encourage lipogenesis) or fructose.

Reviews published as late as 2000 continued to indicate that
the use of HCA as a component in the nutritional therapy for diabetes should focus entirely upon a
reduction in serum free fatty acids with a likely increase in gluconeogenesis that must be counter -
balanced by the ingestion of items such as chromium, biotin or metformin.257 However, by 2003,
the first of many publications confirmed, initially in animal models, that HCA seemingly directly
influences the glucose–insulin system, among others.242,258
Clouatre-Preuss added to the experimental body of knowledge in this area and reviewed the
current literature in an article published in 2008.259 By that time, animal models had confirmed
the impact upon the glucose–insulin system.

For instance, using female mice consuming a low-
fat diet consisting of 3.3% liquid Garcinia cambogia  extract (60% HCA) and supplemented with
10% sucrose water for 4 weeks, it was found that HCA significantly reduced serum insulin without
influencing serum glucose.260 One major surprise from the 2008 article was the striking differ -
ences in efficacy of different HCA salts in affecting the glucose–insulin axis.259 The potassium and
potassium–magnesium hydroxycitrate salts experimentally were quite active in maintaining normal
serum blood sugar with the aid of insulin levels that were only one-half of those in the placebo
animals, but at the relatively low levels of intake used in this study, the potassium–calcium salt
exercised no influence on the insulin system.259
Others have found differences in the efficacy of the HCA salts in influencing insulin sensitivity.

As one example, in a short-term experiment involving a high-glucose diet supplemented with 3%
dietary HCA as potassium–calcium hydroxycitrate following a period of restrictive feeding, blood
glucose levels were significantly reduced; but, as in the 2008 study, there was no significant effect
on insulin with the potassium–calcium HCA salt.261 In published work, potassium–calcium HCA
has influenced serum insulin only when given at levels considerably above those used in the 2008
study (i.e., HCA from a potassium–calcium salt equivalent to 120 mg or higher in rats vs. a maxi -
mum dose of 84 mg of the potassium–magnesium HCA salt) and in an animal model (mouse) that 168 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
the Roche-era studies showed to be much more sensitive to the effects of HCA than is the rat.262
Quite typical in the literature are reports of effects on the insulin system only with experimen -
tal dosages of potassium–calcium hydroxycitrate delivering HCA-free acid equivalents of roughly
five or more times the required dosages from potassium and potassium–magnesium hydroxycitrate.

Several unpublished pilot trials involving diabetics ingesting potassium and potassium–magnesium
hydroxycitrate salts have confirmed that these salts are significantly active in humans, whereas at
normally acceptable dosages the potassium–calcium salts are not (D.L.

Experiments employing a potassium hydroxycitrate salt (the Regulator) at a very high dose
(310 mg/kg body weight, HCA concentration unclear) showed a reduced insulin response to an intra -
gastric glucose load, but no impact on insulin or glucose with an intravenous glucose tolerance
test.263 In a later publication by the same researchers, HCA treatment was found to delay the intes -
tinal absorption of enterally administered glucose at the level of the small intestinal mucosa in rats
and to strongly attenuate postprandial blood glucose levels after both intragastric ( p < .01) and intra -
duodenal ( p < .001) glucose administration.264 The explanation offered is that HCA delays the entry
of glucose into the blood from the gut and that the effect on insulin is secondary to this action.264
At best, this can be only a partial explanation.

An effect on glucose entry into the blood from the
gut under acute conditions does not explain (1) lower insulin with stable serum glucose with chronic
ingestion of HCA for several weeks, i.e., lower insulin with stable serum glucose under conditions
not tied to immediate food intake, (2) glucose challenge data in which animals were not given HCA
immediately before the test and the glucose was delivered intraperitoneally, or (3) the response to a
direct test with insulin injection, which demonstrated better early glucose clearance.

Only improved
insulin sensitivity or actual insulin mimesis would appear to explain these findings, especially the
glucose tolerance and insulin challenge testing in the second experiment in the Clouatre-Preuss arti -
cle.259 Moreover, the glucose challenge approach via intragastric and intraduodenal administration
does not address yet another mechanism that has been identified for HCA’s intervention in carbohy -
drate digestion, to wit, HCA inhibits pancreatic alpha-amylase and intestinal alpha-glucosidase.213
Experiments have begun to hint at unsuspected mechanisms of action for HCA in glucose–
insulin metabolism.

Unpublished in vitro work with cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes challenged
with glucose (Faiyaz Ahmed using a modification of the method of Ravi et al., 2009) quite surpris -
ingly has revealed that the potassium–magnesium salt tested directly induces the uptake of glucose
by these cells even in the complete absence of insulin.265 This effect is considerably stronger in
hepatocytes than in the cardiomyocytes (using glucose concentrations of 5–25 mM).

Interestingly,
there is an additive effect with insulin in the latter, but not the former.

An appealing explanation
for these findings comes from computational docking studies, which serve as direct measures of
the affinity of ligands for receptors.

One such study performed by students of S. Karthi of the
Bioinformatics programs of The University of Texas (El Paso) and SASTRA University (India)
posted in 2012 found that HCA exhibits its highest affinity for the insulin receptor followed by the
11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and farnesoid X receptors.

Although the picture is hardly complete, it is intriguing that this compound that initially was thought
to exert no effect at all on glucose–insulin metabolism, over the last decade and a half has begun to
reveal some of its secrets with significant implications for future research.

Mechanism include, among
others, inhibition of pancreatic alpha -amylase and intestinal alpha -glucosidase, a delay in the absorp -
tion of glucose from the small intestine (involving a sodium pump?

), direct action on the cellular
insulin receptor and, quite possibly, action on the cellular uptake of glucose that is not dependent on
insulin.

Fortunately, for a compound that is this metabolically active, extensive recent safety reviews
have not found properly manufactured HCA to be the source of any major adverse reaction.266169 Potential of Diet and Dietary Supplementation
CONCLUSIONS
Although the concept that refined CHO like sugars in the diet can be hazardous to health when
consumed in excess was proposed many years ago,54,56,60–63,67,69,71 it is only relatively recently that
a general acceptance has become apparent.2,25,114 The most favored, current hypothesis is that the
harm from sugars arise from their ability to bring on perturbations in the glucose–insulin  system,9,54
as well other regulatory systems such as the renin–angiotensin system important for normal
existence.81,89,90 Although we need insulin, too much may present a problem.9,54,71 Lifestyle changes
that overcome the responsible factors offer one solution.

However, carrying out these changes pres -
ents a challenge to most individuals’ ability to comply.

Although long-term use of antidiabetic phar -
maceuticals has been commonly avoided probably because of possible adverse reactions, the use
of safer dietary supplements has been virtually ignored.244,245 Table 7.2 provides a list of numerous
natural agents that have the potential to ameliorate the effects of too much sugar consumption.

We
believe these should be further investigated.

INTRODUCTION
As specialists in natural and complementary medicines, naturopathic doctors (NDs) offer many
treatment options for patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Because our visits are longer
than most primary care providers, we have time to educate patients about dietary and lifestyle prac -
tices that are supportive to optimal health.

We recognize when the body requires additional support through medications and surgery and uti -
lize these modalities when necessary.

Above all, we work with cardiologists and other specialists to
provide the best care for the patient.

We know that most cases of CVD are preventable through proper diet and lifestyle modification.

Many physicians, however, do not have enough time during office visits to give specific nutritional
advice or to discuss healthy living habits with their patients.

A visit with an ND typically lasts
30–60 minutes, and plenty of time is allocated to discussing which diet is appropriate for a par -
ticular cardiovascular condition.

Awareness of healthy eating options is essential for proper meal
planning, so we strive to empower patients by teaching them which foods to eat and which foods to
avoid.

As discussed later, a seemingly healthy vegetarian diet, touted by many to be heart healthy,
may do more harm than good if improper food choices are made.

Learning to identify and address the root cause of cardiovascular dysfunction, such as high
blood pressure, is essential for healing to occur.

Hypertension can be due to many factors including
stress, hormone imbalance, environmental toxin exposure, lack of exercise, medications, obesity,
and/or nutritional deficiencies.

Lowering a surrogate marker such as blood pressure using diuret -
ics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, β-blockers, or other medications never truly
addresses the cause, which if left unchecked will result in additional physiological change and
damage.

Moreover, putting patients on medications is a lot easier than taking them off.

Therefore,
when addressing CVD, physicians must look at all causative factors before recommending treat -
ment options and start with the safest therapies first.

Some statistics show that 60%–90% of doctor visits are stress related.

What can we do for
patients to help minimize stress in their lives?1 What treatments or techniques can we offer for quick
and easy stress reduction?

What effect can yoga, deep breathing, meditation, or biofeedback have on
cardiovascular end points?

We will always have stress in our lives because mortgages, demanding
jobs, sick family members, or living in constant fear or worry are difficult to avoid.

Learning how
to manage these stressors is critical for sound health.

Asking your patients about the stress in their
lives and teaching them methods to reduce it are extremely important considerations in naturopathic
medicine.

In this chapter, we will investigate the multidisciplinary role the naturopath has in the prevention
and treatment of CVD.

Lifestyle optimization through diet, mind body medicines, targeted nutri -
tional supplements, exercise, fasting, grounding, and detoxification techniques will be discussed as
appropriate adjunctive therapies in not only the prevention of CVD and hypertension but also the
overall management.

VEGETARIAN, PALEOLITHIC, AND WESTERN DIETS: FOOD AS MEDICINE
Epidemiological research has looked into the cardioprotective benefits of vegetarian, Mediterranean,
and Paleolithic diets.2–6 These diets all focus on the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts,
and heart-healthy oils (olive and coconut).

They differ in how much, or little, meat, fish, legumes,
dairy, and eggs are consumed.

In this section, modified vegetarian and Paleolithic diets are recom -
mended as medically appropriate diets for preventing and treating heart disease because they elimi -
nate or avoid grains containing gluten.7 They both are very practical diets that improve not only the
health of the cardiovascular system but also vitality in general.

It is very important to know how
to implement and eat healthy vegetarian and Paleolithic diets, as unhealthy versions are common
without proper guidance.

The definition of a vegetarian is one who eats most foods except meat products.

The definition of a vegetarian is one who eats most foods except meat products.

There are vary -
ing levels of vegetarianism, however, as some vegetarians choose to eat fish (pesco-vegetarians)
and/or dairy products and eggs (lacto-ovo vegetarians).

There is a wide range of what is considered
a health-promoting vegetarian diet, as some vegetarians may choose to avoid fish and dairy products
but eat in abundance highly refined, processed, and sugary foods that may promote inflammation 181 Naturopathic Medicine and the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease
in the body.

Avoiding processed, high-sugar, and high-glycemic foods such as wheat is key for sup -
porting cardiovascular health outcomes.8,9
Studies show that eating a vegetarian diet does lead to a reduction in CVD.

A cohort study
comparatively looked at 67 vegetarians and 134 omnivores (consumers of plant and animal origin)
and assessed the risk of CVD.

The vegetarians had a marked reduction in the following measures:
blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio, fasting blood glucose, and elevated total
cholesterol.10 In the Oxford Vegetarian Study, 6000 vegetarians and vegans were compared with
5000 omnivores.

The authors proposed that eating a lifelong vegetarian diet reduced the incidence
of ischemic heart disease by as much as 24%, whereas the incidence was 57% lower among lifelong
vegans, who strictly avoid all animal products including dairy and eggs.

The vegans in this study
had the lowest low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the fish eaters the highest high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.11
It is important to note that high consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fiber is the foundation of
a healthy vegetarian diet and thus contributes to lowered risk of heart disease.12 Eating a vegetarian
diet high in fruits and vegetables and moderately high in fish, eggs, nuts, oils, and gluten-free grains
is conducive to superior heart health.

For patients who want to eat a whole foods diet and consume
animal products, high-quality lean meats such as grass-fed beef, buffalo, bison, and pasture-raised
chicken are healthy options.

This type of gluten- and diary-free diet that promotes high-quality
meats is known as the Paleolithic or hunter–gatherer diet.

The Paleolithic diet is based on what our ancestors ate before the agricultural revolution 10,000

Genetically, we are practically identical to our Paleolithic ancestors, yet the Western diet
is drastically different in macro- and micronutrients; phytonutrients; electrolytes; and composition
of fats, proteins, and particularly carbohydrates.13 Some say that the preagricultural diet should be
the standard for contemporary human nutrition considering the genetic similarity to our Paleolithic
ancestors.14
The typical hunter–gatherer culture consumed sweet and ripe fruits and berries, shoots, flow -
ers, buds and young leaves, meat, bone marrow, organ meats, fish, shellfish, insects, larvae, eggs,
roots, bulbs, nuts, and nongrass seeds.6 These hunter–gatherers relied on finding food rather than
cultivating it.

Grains and diary were not available and thus were not consumed.13 In fact, Dr. David
Permutter, author of Grain Brain , reports that humans have eaten gluten free for 99.9% of our exis -
tence.15 This statistic puts into perspective why so many people feel better on gluten-free diets; we
have been eating gluten free for the majority of our time on the earth.

It is thought that hunter–gatherers had greater metabolic output due to their mobile nature and
greater caloric intake compared to modern man.14,16 The high nutrient content of wildly harvested
foods and game helped sustain their greater metabolic needs.

Considering the high carbohydrate
intake of modern man coupled with no to minimal exercise, it is no wonder why the obesity epi -
demic is out of control.17 Low-fat diets rarely seem to work well for weight loss, as more carbohy -
drates (sugars) are consumed in place of fats.

The Paleolithic diet selects low-sugar carbohydrates
and allows consumption of high-quality fats.

Traditional hunter–gatherers who eat a Paleo-type diet have shown exceptionally favorable lev -
els of serum cholesterol, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular risk factors.6 In a 12-week study
where pigs were fed a Paleo-type diet or cereal diet, the pigs eating Paleo had lower C-reactive
protein (CRP), lower blood pressure, and higher insulin sensitivity.

The authors of this study sug -
gest that diseases of affluence may be attributable to insufficient evolutionary adaptation to grains.18
If we compare the Paleolithic diet to the Western diet, we see stark differences in nutrient com -
position, antioxidants, fiber, and sugar intake.

Overall, hunter–gatherers consumed less sodium and
more potassium, riboflavin, folate, thiamin, carotene, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E.19 They
also consumed more fiber (100–150 vs. 24 g/day), more meat (45%–60% vs. 12% total calories),
more cholesterol (520 vs. 430 mg/day), and fewer carbohydrates (22%–46% vs. 50% total calories).

One of the most shocking differences between Paleolithic diet and Western diet is the consump -
tion of refined sugar.

Because refined sugar did not exist in hunter–gatherer societies, 0 kg/year 182 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
were consumed compared to 69.1 kg/year in the United States in 2000.19 This translates to 152 lb
of refined sugar being consumed by Americans every year.

According to Dr. Staffan Lindeberg,
“roughly three-fourth of the calories in Western countries is today provided by foods that were
practically unavailable during human evolution: wheat and other cereal grains, dairy foods, refined
fats, and sugar.”
When you consider the proinflammatory nature of refined sugar,20 it comes as no surprise why
chronic disease is rising steadily and why CVD is the number one cause of mortality in the United
States.

As a culture, Americans are consuming too much sugar and too many carbohydrate calories
sourced from grains.

According to a small randomized clinical trial, consuming sugar-sweetened
beverages (SSBs) for 3 weeks led to increases in waist to hip ratio, fasting blood glucose, and
hs-CRP levels.

The researches also noted a decrease in LDL particle size.20 People need to be aware
that sugar is very toxic for the body even in socially acceptable portion sizes (12 oz.

soda), and that
drinking these sugar beverages regularly can increase the risk for CVD.

Underlying chronic inflammation is emerging as the pivotal risk factor in the genesis of CVD.

Sugar and highly refined foods are thought to cause inflammation in the body particularly in the
endothelial lining (or innermost membrane) of blood vessels.

To say it bluntly, sugar and subsequent
insulin surges are the most endothelial unfriendly components that promote oxidative stress.

As
a rise in blood sugar leads to inflammation in the endothelial lining, the body reacts by deposit -
ing cholesterol along the walls of the blood vessels as a protective mechanism to stabilize and
strengthen the vessel.

This is the inflammatory cascade that leads to atherosclerosis, one of the most
common contributors to heart disease.

By removing or at least dramatically decreasing sugar from
a diet, you are eliminating a key player in the inflammatory response to heart disease.

WHEAT (GLUTEN), BLOOD SUGAR, AND INFLAMMATION
One of the biggest players responsible for this inflammation is a grain hidden in almost all packaged
or processed foods: wheat.

WHEAT (GLUTEN), BLOOD SUGAR, AND INFLAMMATION
One of the biggest players responsible for this inflammation is a grain hidden in almost all packaged
or processed foods: wheat.

It is found in breads, bagels, pastas, pizzas, pastries, pretzels, wraps,
crackers, candy bars, soy sauce, and other foods.

For decades, the medical establishment has sup -
ported consuming a moderate intake of grains including wheat.

If you browse grocery store aisles
and analyze the endless array of processed foods, you may see an endorsement from the American
Diabetes Association or American Heart Association.

We are taught from a very young age that
grains including wheat are good for us.

Over the years, wheat has dominated the market in processed foods that are convenient, inexpen -
sive, and long lasting.

The wheat found in most foods these days, however, is not the same wheat that
was around decades ago, nor is it healthy for you.

According to Dr. William Davis, author of Wheat
Belly , modern wheat genes have been spliced over 50,000 times to make it more desirable (i.e., pest
or drought resistant, higher gluten content, etc.

), but in the process a toxic form of wheat has been
created.

The gene splicing has transformed the wheat species into one of the highest glycemic index
foods that humans consume, a glycemic index higher than that of even table sugar.21
Higher glycemic index foods, like wheat, are broken down into sugar.

Sugar raises insulin levels,
and high insulin levels are proinflammatory, accelerating the aging process.

Higher blood sug -
ars in combination with proteins and lipids in the plasma create advanced glycation end products
(AGEs).22 AGEs not only accelerate aging but also cause enormous oxidative stress in the body at
the same time.

Never in the history of modern man has diabetes, insulin resistance, and metabolic
syndrome been expressed in the population at such an accelerating rate, largely due to our modern
industrial food production.

Flooding the body with sugar is only going to aggravate preexisting
heart disease and make it more challenging to reverse.

Gluten consumption may not only contribute to inflammation in the arteries but also lead to
inflammation in the intestines.

In a landmark study out in The Lancet , Dr. Alessio Fasano discov -
ered an intestinal protein called zonulin elevated in people with celiac disease.

In the small intestine,
zonulin induces tight junction disassembly, which leads to an increase in intestinal permeability.23 183 Naturopathic Medicine and the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease
In other words, gluten consumption can cause leaky gut syndrome.

The intestines become inflamed,
and “leaky” contents of the intestinal tract including bacterium and undigested food proteins are
allowed to pass through the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream.24 Chronically, this can lead
to an overactivation of the immune system that may set the stage for autoimmune disease and other
chronic inflammatory conditions.

Surprisingly, even individuals who do not have celiac disease are
susceptible to zonulin elevations.

Gliadin, one of the proteins found in gluten, can trigger zonulin
release temporarily regardless of whether someone has celiac disease or not.25 Therefore, all of us
are susceptible to the increased intestinal permeability due to gluten consumption.

Hypertension can be caused by oxidative stress, inflammation, and autoimmune dysfunction.26
Because there is a connection between leaky gut syndrome, inflammation in the intestines, and
autoimmune disease, could gluten consumption be a contributing factor for the emergence of hyper -
tension?

Clinically, I have seen better blood pressure control after putting patients on gluten-free
diets.

Clinically, I have seen better blood pressure control after putting patients on gluten-free
diets.

Although the exact mechanism of action for this finding is unknown, could regulating blood
sugar and decreasing intestinal inflammation be responsible for reducing oxidative stress in blood
vessels, leading to a decrease in blood pressure?

Further study will perhaps shed more light on this
theory.

KNOW THY FOOD SOURCE
When choosing to eat a vegetarian diet, it is very important to limit or completely eliminate gluten
and to make sure that particular vitamins are replenished.

Unhealthy vegetarians are those who
typically consume high quantities of gluten and sugar products in place of meat products.

They too
suffer from most of the modern world’s chronic diseases that are highly preventable through healthy
eating.

Many wheat-free (gluten-free) grains are beneficial to consume, and these include quinoa,
amaranth, millet, and buckwheat.

Legumes such as lentils and beans can also be eaten in modera -
tion to provide additional fiber, B vitamins, calcium, and iron.

Although vegetarian diets are high in fiber, vitamin C, vitamin E, folic acid, magnesium, and
potassium, strict vegetarians and vegans have been known to be deficient in vitamin B12,  vitamin D,
zinc, and long-chain ω-3 fatty acids.27,28 Low levels of vitamin B12, found in meat and eggs, cause an
increase in plasma homocysteine, an amino acid linked with heart disease.29 It is therefore impor -
tant for vegetarians to supplement with vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin B6 to help metabolize
methionine more efficiently, thus lowering homocysteine.30 Because meat and eggs are consumed
regularly on a Paleolithic diet, most Paleo followers do not need to take additional B vitamins,
carnitine, α-lipoic acid, and coenzyme Q10 as these nutrients are found in abundance in the animal
kingdom.

It can be challenging to find high-quality meat sources.

The majority of red meat and chicken
in the United States is factory farmed.

Factory-farmed animals eat genetically modified soy and
corn, are housed in extremely inhumane quarters, and fed and injected with antibiotics to treat and
prevent infection.

When choosing to eat a Paleolithic type diet, it is important to select the meats
wisely.

Typically, local farmers markets and health food stores sell grass-fed beef or pasture-
raised chickens and eggs.

Although the cost of pasture-raised meat is slightly higher compared
to factory-farmed meats, trans fat levels are lower, whereas ω-3 fatty acid levels are significantly
higher.31–33
Choosing to eat a whole foods diet, whether vegetarian or Paleolithic, will help promote healthy
eating habits and help reduce risk for CVD.6,10 Both diets thrive on eating lots of fruits and veg -
etables (raw and cooked), and in moderation, nuts, seeds, eggs, and fish.

Paleolithic diets include
meats, and I recommend sourcing high-quality grass-fed or pasture-raised local meats when pos -
sible to optimize healthy fats.

Vegetarian diets do include grains, but I suggest eliminating gluten-
containing grains, particularly wheat, to minimize sugar intake.

In summary, I recommend either
diet depending on one’s personal preference but cannot emphasize the importance of gluten (wheat)
elimination and choice of high-quality meats without chemicals and pesticides.184 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Care should be taken in those with moderate to severe diabetes as blood sugar levels may drop
when beginning a Paleolithic or vegetarian diet.

Make sure your diabetic patients are closely moni -
toring blood sugar, as hypoglycemia is not uncommon.

Remember that radically shifting a diet from
highly refined, processed, and sugary foods/drinks to one of healthy whole foods can dramatically
affect body physiology, so be watchful and check in regularly with your patients.

NATUROPATHIC APPROACH TO TREATING HYPERTENSION
In the United States, nearly half of all Americans have elevated blood pressures in the prehyper -
tensive (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 120–139 or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 80–89) to hyper -
tensive (SBP > 140 or DBP > 90) range.34 This statistic is alarming considering the deleterious
effects of high blood pressure and negative sequelae including stroke, CVD, and kidney disease.

Although antihypertensive medications are effective in the reduction of blood pressure, adherence
is often poor and cost is high.34 Additionally, side effects are common with antihypertensive medi -
cations and include hypokalemia, insomnia, depression, dry mouth, bronchospasm, impotence, and
headaches.35 It is therefore suggested that prehypertensive and hypertensive patients pursue comple -
mentary therapies including diet and lifestyle modifications, and mind–body medicines, to assist in
blood pressure control.34
There is overwhelming evidence supporting the use of lifestyle measures to reduce blood pres -
sure.

Most physicians, however, are quick to prescribe pharmaceuticals before addressing a patient’s
diet and lifestyle.

Health care in the United States is more like disease care, with an emphasis on
drugs and surgery and a lack of attention for prevention.

A naturopath’s goal is to help change pre -
scription pad readiness into education and self-responsibility.

Patients need to be exposed to the
most up-  to-date evidence-based medicines possible and to be able to make informed decisions about
their treatment plan.

In this section on hypertension, evidence-based diet and lifestyle modifications
including nutraceuticals that reduce blood pressure without the use of pharmaceuticals are addressed.

One of the foundations of medicine is learning how to identify and treat the cause of disease.

Often we focus too much attention on treating the symptom, which will only alleviate the prob -
lem temporarily.

For acute conditions like a myocardial infarction, treating the symptom such as
acute coronary syndrome or unstable angina with nitroglycerine is necessary to reduce pain and
perfuse blood-starved heart muscle.

It is not the ideal time or place for dietary recommendations
or stress reduction management.

Knowing how and when to address the cause is a fine art, and it
takes time and effort to uncover.

Help your patients learn why they have a symptom or disease.

For most patients with essential hypertension, there is an underlying cause that can be identified
with proper questions and insight.

If we think of hypertension like an alarm going off in a burning
building, prescribing a diuretic, an ACE inhibitor, a β-blocker, or an ARB is analogous to turning
off the alarm without addressing the fire.

We need to know where the alarm is going off, why it is
making noise, and how to turn it off.

Once we investigate the source of the fire, we can treat it using
proper lifestyle measures like a noninflammatory diet, stress control, and targeted nutraceuticals.

Occasionally, the fire may be burning out of control and require immediate attention with medica -
tion.

This is usually a hypertensive crisis where blood pressure is higher than 180/110 mmHg, or
when renal function is impaired.

Learning how to treat hypertension with natural medicines takes patience, time, and effort.

In my clinical practice, many factors go into deciding whether a medication is required to lower
blood pressure.

The most important ones are blood pressure levels, family and past medical history,
age, exercise, diet, stress level, smoking, environmental toxin exposure, oxidative stress, comor -
bidities (e.g., diabetes and autoimmune disease), medications, and motivation to make changes.

Unfortunately, there is no simple algorithm to help you decide whether to use medication or not.

There are over a dozen recommendations in this section for natural ways to lower blood pressure.

Unfortunately, there is no simple algorithm to help you decide whether to use medication or not.

There are over a dozen recommendations in this section for natural ways to lower blood pressure.

Although some interventions only lower blood pressure modestly, cumulatively these treatments
can have a profound impact on the cardiovascular system.185 Naturopathic Medicine and the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease
Identifying and treating the etiology of hypertension can be challenging as many causes can
overlap and create confusion.

For instance, the following commonly contribute to hypertension
cases: nutritional deficiencies, stress, endocrine dysfunction (e.g., hyperthyroidism), obesity, lack of
exercise, smoking, alcohol, and prescription medications (e.g., NSAIDS and birth control).

Other
causes need to be ruled out as well such as renal disease, hyperaldosteronism, Cushing’s disease,
coarctation of the aorta, and white-coat hypertension.

How do you truly know what is contributing
to the patient’s elevated blood pressure?

As an ND, I cannot emphasize the importance of spending ample time questioning your patient
about his or her current and past health.

Without hesitation, ask your patients about their diet and
nutrient intake, weight, exercise, lifestyle (i.e., smoking, alcohol intake), stress, and prescription
drug use.

What foods and fluids are they regularly consuming?

What is their home and work life
like?

Are they shift workers?

What is their level of emotional stress?

Are they unhappy or unful -
filled?

Asking these types of questions can not only help unravel a complex case but also build a
strong patient–doctor relationship, which is an important step for healing to occur.

If there is no
obvious cause after an in-depth intake, basic laboratories (CBC, TSH, BUN, GFR, CR, aldoste -
rone, and cortisol) and imaging (renal ultrasound and echocardiogram) may help to determine the
cause.

The bottom line is to spend time with your patients, ask appropriate questions, and thoroughly
investigate their case.

Even if the cause is very challenging to determine and treat, always address
diet and lifestyle.

You may learn from reviewing a simple diet diary that your hypertensive patient
eats a bag of potato chips at night because she is angry with a coworker.

The high sodium and trans
fat intake coupled with sustained cortisol release from chronic stress is setting the stage for CVD
including hypertension.

Instead of prescribing a diuretic, talk about the patient’s stress and offer
suggestions to alleviate emotional toxicity and thus emotional eating.

DIET, LIFESTYLE, AND HYPERTENSION
How many times have you heard that healthy eating, exercise, restricted salt intake, and stress
reduction are supportive for blood pressure control?

Why are these therapies often overlooked, and
why do doctors willingly reach for the prescription pad so quickly?

I believe it is important to know
quantitatively how much these lifestyle factors can influence SBP and DBP.

One of the roles of a
physician is to educate patients about the risk/benefit ratio of a treatment plan, and this includes
lifestyle changes as well as medications.

Learn to become familiar with other therapies besides
medications, which takes time and patience.

In medicine, it is easy to get caught up in treating num -
bers (blood pressure) when ultimately we are treating people.

For hypertensive patients, I generally recommend a whole food diet similar to the modified
Paleolithic and vegetarian diets discussed earlier.

This type of diet includes fresh fruits, vegeta -
bles, nuts, seeds, heart healthy oils (olive and coconut), pasture-raised eggs and lean meats, fish,
non-gluten grains (i.e., brown rice, quinoa, and amaranth), and legumes (lentils and beans).

This
means eating little to no processed and fast foods, as these “foods” contain mainly sugar, toxic fats,
genetically modified organisms (GMOs), preservatives, food colorings, and a whole list of other
chemicals.

Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine, once said, “let food be thy medicine and
medicine be thy food.” In other words, eat real foods to support, nourish, and heal the body.

The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet contains the foods mentioned plus
low-fat dairy.

Research shows that it can lower SBP and DBP by 5.5 and 3.3 mmHg, respec -
tively.36 Some large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) looking at the DASH diet show even
greater reductions in SBP of approximately 11 mmHg and DBP of 5 mmHg.37 For reducing blood
pressure, I do support a DASH-type diet.

Overall, I believe that it is a very healthy diet and very
similar to the Mediterranean diet.

I do make minor modifications, however, that include a reduction
in gluten-containing grains, a preference for full-fat organic dairy products, and a smarter option
for cooking oils.186 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
I find that too many servings of grains particularly wheat can contribute to fluctuations in blood
sugar and insulin levels, and therefore fluctuations in blood pressure.

Remember, wheat is a grain
consumed in excess these days due to the prevalence of packaged and fast foods and has a very high
glycemic index.

High glycemic index foods turn into sugar in the body.

In a prospective study look -
ing at the sugar content of SSBs, reducing the intake of 1 SSB a day lead to a clinically significant
drop in blood pressure of 1.1–1.8 mmHg over 18 months.38 As an added bonus, weight can also drop
from eliminating this extraneous sugar source.

Therefore, when possible reduce wheat and grain
consumption as lowering intake will invariably lead to better glycemic control, and thus reduced
blood pressure.

On the DASH diet, low-fat dairy products are recommended.

There is moderate research sug -
gesting an inverse relationship between dairy consumption and blood pressure, although more clini -
cal research is needed to delineate a casual relationship.39 If choosing to consume dairy, try to buy
organic full-fat products instead, as low-fat products typically contain more sugar and other addi -
tives that may not be conducive to optimal blood pressure control.

Studies show that cows fed grass
instead of grains have higher levels of ω-3 fatty acids in their milk.40 If available, consume organic
grass fed dairy products as the fatty acid profile is more desirable.

Also, organic dairy products
should not contain any hormone by-products, which may lead to oxidative stress in the body.

The DASH diet suggests consuming two to three servings a day of fats and oils including veg -
etable oil and/or margarine.

I do not recommend these oils because they may contain trans fats and
may promote free radical oxidation in the body, particularly the blood vessels.

Instead, I like olive
and coconut oil for supporting cardiovascular health.

Studies on olive oil show promising reductions
in blood pressure when consumed in upward of 60 g (4 tbsp) a day.41 The oleic acid present in olive
oil may be responsible for the blood pressure–lowering effect.

Coconut oil is a very stable oil and
great to use for high-heat cooking.

In a recent study, virgin coconut oil fed to rats helped prevent
blood pressure elevation, which the authors suggest may be due to a reduction in vasoconstriction
of the endothelium.42 Therefore, do not hesitate to use olive and coconut oils with your food as they
exert cardioprotective qualities.

With regard to fluids, I recommend consuming mainly filtered water and avoiding excessive
alcohol and caffeine intake.

With regard to fluids, I recommend consuming mainly filtered water and avoiding excessive
alcohol and caffeine intake.

In a meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials, reducing alcohol
intake lowered SBP and DBP by 3.31 and 2.04 mmHg, respectively.43 Caffeine intake mainly from
coffee elicits very minor increases in blood pressure, so I suggest coffee in moderation.44 Remember,
blood sugar swings can contribute to fluctuations in blood pressure.

Minimally consume desserts
and highly refined carbohydrates and sugary foods, as sugar will also trigger a neurohormonal
response leading to an elevation in blood pressure.

In addition to consuming filtered water, some studies show promising reductions in blood pres -
sure with the use of hibiscus tea.

Hibiscus flowers contain anthocyanins, which are thought to
exhibit blood pressure–lowering effects through mild ACE inhibitor and diuretic actions.

In a ran -
domized, double blind, and placebo-controlled trial, 3240 mL servings per day of hibiscus tea were
administered for 6 weeks to prehypertensive and mildly hypertensive adults.

Compared to placebo,
those consuming hibiscus tea had lower SBP and DBP by 7.2 and 3.1 mmHg, respectively.45 In two
other RCTs (one of them double blinded), hibiscus tea was almost comparable to the ACE inhibitors
lisinopril and captopril in lowering blood pressure with a wide margin of tolerability and safety.46,47
Patients commonly ask me about salt and whether they can add it to meals.

Excessive salt intake
is associated with an elevation in blood pressure48 and an increased risk for CVD, renal disease, and
stroke.49 In a meta-analysis of 34 trials, researchers found that a reduction in salt intake of 4 g/ day
led to reductions in SBP and DBP of 4.18 and 2.06 mmHg, respectively, in normotensive and hyper -
tensive individuals.

They propose that reducing salt intake to 4 to 5 g/day can have a major effect on
blood pressure and that lowering it to 3 g/day offers the most cardioprotective benefits.50 As refer -
ence, 3 g of sodium a day is just over 1 tsp of salt.

The main source of salt in the standard American diet is processed food products such as canned
goods, fast foods, pickles, chips, candies, and processed meats.

If the aforementioned foods are 187 Naturopathic Medicine and the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease
consumed infrequently, it is okay in moderation to add high-quality sea salt (a “pinch”) to meals as
this can actually benefit digestion and provide essential trace minerals.

It should be noted that increasing potassium in the diet or via a supplement can lower the risk of
stroke51 and help reduce blood pressure.52 According to research, if 4.7 g/day of dietary potassium
are consumed, SBP and DBP can decrease by 8.0 and 4.1 mmHg, respectively.

A potassium-induced
reduction in blood pressure can offer other cardiovascular benefits including a reduction in myo -
cardial infarction and coronary heart disease.53 In a large prospective study of 43,738 men, greater
potassium intake through diet resulted in a lowered incidence of stroke.51 If supplemental potassium
is administered, care should be taken in those patients taking potassium-sparing medications or
with renal disease.53
EXERCISE AND HYPERTENSION
Regular exercise can reduce blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive individuals.

In a
meta-analysis of 54 randomized controlled trials, aerobic exercise could lower SBP and DBP by
3.84 and 2.58 mmHg, respectively.54 One study had participants exercise three to four times per
week for 1 hour at 75%–85% of their initial heart rate (HR) reserve, and then this group was com -
pared to an exercise and weight management group.

The participants in the exercise and weight
management group had the greatest reductions in SBP and DBP of 7 and 5 mmHg, respectively.55
The lesson to learn from this study is exercise coupled with weight loss promotes greater blood pres -
sure control than exercise alone.

Research reports that modest increases in exercise of 61–90 min/week can decrease blood pres -
sure in a sedentary hypertensive population.56 One study indicated that 10,000 steps per day, regard -
less of duration or intensity, are effective in lowering blood pressure and reducing sympathetic nerve
activity.57 Walking for most people is a simple form of exercise that can benefit the cardiovascular
system.

I recommend exercise that is practical, convenient, and enjoyable, and for most people a
20-minute walk in the neighborhood will suffice.

It also provides time to walk with a loved one or
pet or enjoy the quiet solitude of nature.

STRESS, BREATHING, AND HYPERTENSION
One of the most important, and often neglected, lifestyle measures to address with your patients
is stress.

Stress exists in many forms and may include situational (e.g., car accident), mental (e.g.,
anxiety), emotional (e.g., fear, guilt), physical (e.g., chronic back pain), chemical (e.g., pesticides),
oxidative (e.g., heavy metals and electromagnetic radiation [EMR]) and psycho-spiritual (e.g., rela -
tionship and career).

We all manage stress on a daily basis whether it is paying bills, sitting in
traffic, caring for a sick family member, or constantly connecting through social media.

These
stressors have a cumulative effect that can result in chronic stimulation of the sympathetic nervous
system.

An overactive sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronically elevated vasoconstrictive
stress hormones that set the stage for hypertension.58 When under chronic stress, the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal axis overproduces glucocorticoid and catecholamine hormones.

These “fight or
flight” hormones include cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine and can elevate blood sugar and
blood pressure, causing significant neurohormonal changes including immune system dysfunction.

Acutely activating this fight or flight system is advantageous because heart rate, respiratory rate,
and blood flow increase and our ability to react to stimuli is enhanced.

We desperately need these
hormones to survive, but balancing them in a chronically stressful environment is key to supporting
cardiovascular health.

One method to calm an overactive sympathetic nervous system is to increase parasympa -
thetic tone.

Many mind–body therapies including tai chi, qigong, yoga, biofeedback, and medi -
tation and/or slow belly breathing help reduce stress by activating parasympathetic pathways.

188 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
When practiced regularly, these therapies can have a profound impact on quality of life and
can reduce blood pressure as well.59–65 These mind–body therapies have a common denomina -
tor: meditation through habitual breathing.

Learning how to breathe, and building awareness
around breathing exercises, is likely why these therapies are beneficial for lowering blood
pressure; breathing encourages parasympathetic tone in the body, which in turn supports heart
rate variability.

Increasing heart rate variability is a major prognosticator in protecting cardio -
vascular health.66
Biofeedback can be used to slow breathing rate and, therefore, help lower blood pressure.

In a
small RCT, 22 menopausal women with prehypertension were assigned to either a control group
(slow abdominal breathing) or an experimental group.

The experimental group performed ten
25-minute sessions of slow abdominal breathing (six cycles per minute) combined with frontal elec -
tromyographic biofeedback training and daily home practice.

The biofeedback training involved
muscle relaxation techniques and guided imagery.

The experimental group showed the greatest
reductions in SBP and DBP of 8.4 and 3.9 mmHg, respectively.

The control group experienced a
small drop in SBP of 4.3 mmHg but no significant drop in DBP.

The researchers conclude that slow
breathing at six cycles a minute coupled with biofeedback training is an effective intervention to
manage prehypertension.67
In addition to biofeedback, breathing devices can also help regulate blood pressure.

In a ran -
domized double blind placebo-controlled study, participants were able to lower their blood pres -
sure using a breathe with interactive music (BIM) device for 10 minutes every evening.

The BIM
device guided users on how to breathe slowly and regularly using sound patterns.

A control group
listened to a walkman with quiet music.

At the end of the 8-week study, BIM participants lowered
SBP and DBP by 15.2 and 10 mmHg, respectively, and control group participants by 11.3 and
5.6 mmHg, respectively.

These findings suggest that a calming cardiovascular response opposite to
that caused by mental stress is responsible for the decrease in blood pressure in both groups.

The
lower blood pressure in the BIM group is further attributed to breathing modulation.68 These BIM
devices produced reductions in blood pressure similar to those found by commonly prescribed
antihypertensives.

In an RCT of 79 patients using device-guided breathing exercises (DGBE), hypertensive medi -
cated participants spent 15 min/day practicing deep breathing at home.

Blood pressures were mea -
sured at home and in office over an 8-week period.

By the end of the study, the participants using
DGBE had a reduction in SBP of 5.5 mmHg and DBP of 3.6 mmHg.69 These results from the previ -
ous two studies show that breathing devices, commonly available to patients, can help lower blood
pressure by assisting with deep breathing exercises.

Moreover, reductions in blood pressure can be
seen weeks after cessation of treatment.

Many of these aforementioned studies use machines to guide breathing.

Other practices such as
yoga or tai chi focus on breathing as well.

It is important to understand that it is not the machine that
is lowering blood pressure but the habitual practice of breathing.

One of the reasons why yoga is so
popular is because the practice not only supports the musculoskeletal system with stretching and
posture alignment but also teaches people to breathe properly.

Effectively learning how to breathe
can take time and practice.

Fortunately, biofeedback and breathing machines, breathing exercises,
teachers, or group work can help develop awareness about how to breathe.

Out of all the meditation practices, Transcendental Meditation (TM) seems to offer the greatest
blood pressure–lowering effect.70 TM is a nonreligious meditation technique that focuses on man -
tra repetition for 20 minutes two times a day.

It is thought to promote relaxation and can bring the
meditator into a deeper state of consciousness.

In a meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled
trials looking at TM and its effect on blood pressure, regular practice of TM has the potential to
approximately lower SBP and DBP by 4.7 and 3.2 mmHg, respectively.71 In one RCT, 298 univer -
sity students were assigned to a TM program or wait list control.

The students in the TM program
exhibited lower SBP and DBP, and improvements were noted in total psychological stress, anxiety,
depression, anger/hostility, and coping.72189 Naturopathic Medicine and the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease

For people who want to practice breathing on their own, I teach a simple breathing exercise that
takes 15 minutes to complete.

First, I recommend that patients sit down on the edge of a chair to
help align the spine.

Lying supine in the shavasana  yoga pose is another option.

First, I recommend that patients sit down on the edge of a chair to
help align the spine.

Lying supine in the shavasana  yoga pose is another option.

Then I tell patients
to imagine a balloon in their lower abdomen inflating and deflating with each breath.

This helps to
develop belly breathing instead of chest breathing, which we are more inclined to do when under
stress.

Now start breathing.

Breathe in for two counts and then breathe out for two counts.

Do this
for a couple of cycles and increase to three counts in and three counts out.

Repeat for a couple
of cycles and increase to four counts in and four counts out.

Again, repeat and breathe in for five
counts and breathe out for five counts.

This breathing pattern typically results in five to six breaths
per minute.

It may take a few days or a week to settle at five to six breaths a minute, so be patient.

This technique of slow deep breathing is very useful because it helps to focus our attention away
from stress and reduce ruminating thoughts by allowing the mind to be in the present moment.

Slow
deep breathing will invariably lower blood pressure as well.

The goal of this breathing exercise
is to habituate natural functional breathing by slowing it down and making it deeper.

One study
having participants breathe at six cycles per minute showed an increase in baroreceptor sensitivity
and a decrease in sympathetic activity and chemoreflex activation, which are potential beneficial
effects for treating hypertension.73 Regardless of what breathing technique you suggest to your
patients, persistence is the foundation for success.

Structured breathing every day will achieve posi -
tive results and may help take your patient to another level in their meditation practice.

TARGETED NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS, BOTANICAL
MEDICINES, AND ACUPUNCTURE AND HYPERTENSION
Although there is no question that hypertensive medications significantly lower blood pressure, and
reduce CVD events and stroke, side effects are common and cost can be prohibitive.

Many patients
these days are searching for a more holistic approach to treating hypertension and demand alter -
natives for drug therapy.

When blood pressure elevation is mild to moderate (prehypertension to
stage I hypertension), diet and lifestyle interventions should be addressed first as these treatments
are fundamental to sound health.

In addition to diet and lifestyle changes (e.g., exercise, fasting,
and meditation), targeted nutritional supplements, botanical medicines, and acupuncture can further
lower blood pressure.

These natural medicine treatments may be necessary to get blood pressure
under control quickly while diet and lifestyle measures take effect and can help wean patients off
certain hypertensive medications.

Although there are multiple targeted supplements to choose from,
I have had the most success with coenzyme Q10, magnesium, ω-3 fatty acids, garlic, and rauwolfia
to name a few.

Coenzyme Q10 (which is discussed in detail in Chapter 12) is a powerful antioxidant found in
all human cells.

It helps to support adenosine triphosphate turnover in the mitochondria, is a mem -
brane stabilizer, and can help reduce inflammatory markers.74,75 Although the exact mechanism is
unknown in humans for reducing blood pressure, CoQ10 does reduce peripheral resistance through
nitric oxide preservation and acts as a potent free radical scavenger helping to reduce free radical
stress.76 Whereas some studies show mixed results with CoQ10 for blood pressure control, other
studies show a moderate reduction in blood pressure.

One randomized, double blind, and placebo
controlled trial found a mean reduction in SBP of 17.8 mmHg.77 In a Cochrane meta-analysis of
three double-blinded, placebo-controlled studies, mean decreases in SBP and DBP were 11 and
7 mmHg, respectively.

It should be noted that the authors of this analysis were concerned about
the quality of blinding, and author credibility.78 The typical dose for CoQ10 supplementation is
100–200 mg a day.

Side effects are rarely seen.

Magnesium is a mineral involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body.

It may help reduce
blood pressure due to the mild smooth muscle relaxation and Ca2+ ion antagonizing effects.

A recent 190 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
meta-analysis of 22 trials showed that 410 mg (mean dosage) of magnesium can reduce SBP by 3–4
mmHg and DBP by 2–3 mmHg.79–81 As many people are deficient in magnesium because of decreas -
ing soil concentrations and poor dietary habits including excessive caffeine and alcohol intake, it may
be worthwhile to measure magnesium red blood cell levels and supplement if low levels are found.

Magnesium is available in many different forms (citrate, chloride, glycinate, oxide, and aspartate),
and the doses can range from 200 to 600 mg/day.

Side effects may include diarrhea or abdominal
cramping if dosed too high, and magnesium should not be given to patients with renal insufficiency.

There are many studies on fish oil supplementation and increased fish intake for the treatment
of blood pressure for medicated and unmedicated hypertensive patients.

Some studies show mod -
est reductions in blood pressure.

In a recent meta-analysis of 17 studies, researches concluded that
reductions in SBP of 2.56 mmHg and DBP of 1.47 mmHg were found with fish oil supplementation.

Varying doses of fish oil including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
were used in this analysis.

Although a small reduction in blood pressure was found, the researchers
state that a 2-mmHg reduction in SBP can lower mortality by 10% for strokes and mortality by 7%
for ischemic heart disease.82 Typical doses for fish oil are 2–3 g/day.

Side effects may include burp -
ing and abdominal discomfort.

Garlic as a food-based supplement is very helpful for reducing blood pressure.

In one meta-anal -
ysis of 10 trials, participants with hypertension (SBP > 140 mmHg) experienced reductions in SBP
and DBP by 16.3 and 9.3 mmHg, respectively.

There was no clinically significant drop in SBP or
DBP in normotensive participants, however.83 Similar results were found in another meta-analysis of
hypertensive participants where reductions in SBP of 8.4 and in DBP 7.3 of mmHg were observed.84
These findings suggest that garlic supplementation may help reduce blood pressure in hypertensive
individuals.

It should be noted that many forms of garlic were used in these studies and that the
average dose was 600–900 mg/day providing 3.6–5.4 mg of allicin, the active compound in garlic.84
As a side note, garlic cloves generally contain 5–9 mg of allicin, so they may be used in cooking to
achieve some hypotensive benefits.

Garlic may interact with some pharmaceuticals such as couma -
din, so make sure you look up possible herb–drug interactions before initializing treatment.

There are many other food-based supplements and nutraceuticals that help reduce blood pres -
sure.

According to Dr. Mark Houston, who recently published an article summarizing nonphar -
macological approaches to treating hypertension, the following can also assist in blood pressure
control: taurine; L-arginine; vitamins E, C, D, and B6; flavonoids; quercetin; α-lipoic acid; N-acetyl
cysteine; melatonin; grape seed extract; pomegranate juice; black and green tea; chocolate; sesame;
and seaweed.85 Many of these vitamins and nutrients can be found in whole foods, which brings us
back to the notion of food as medicine.

They can also be taken in supplement form.

In Chapter 9,
the reader will investigate foods and supplements in more detail.

Traditionally, botanical medicines have been used to lower blood pressure and support the heart.

In Chapter 9,
the reader will investigate foods and supplements in more detail.

Traditionally, botanical medicines have been used to lower blood pressure and support the heart.

Many naturopathic physicians and herbalists compound antihypertensive botanical formulas that
may contain the following herbs: hawthorn, rauwolfia, rosemary, dandelion leaf, mistletoe, coleus
forskohlii, and arjuna.

Although there is some research to support their use, a physician must
intensely study these herbs and interactions to feel confident enough to prescribe them.

Most herbal
medicines are very safe to use, but caution must be taken particularly if patients are taking multiple
hypertensive pharmaceuticals concurrently.

NDs often use botanical formulas to wean a patient off a pharmaceutical while addressing diet
and lifestyle changes.86 The aforementioned herbs, especially rauwolfia, have been used with great
success.

When prescribing rauwolfia, however, you must be careful about potential drug interac -
tions including MAO inhibitors.

Severe depression and Parkinson’s disease are contraindications.

Because rauwolfia contains the alkaloid reserpine, side effects are not uncommon, so care needs to
be taken when prescribing this herb.

Acupuncture is a system of medicine that has been around for thousands of years and can help
treat hypertension.

Although research does support its use for reducing blood pressure, many of
the trials have unclear methodological quality and most are in other languages other than English 191 Naturopathic Medicine and the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease
(i.e., Chinese and Russian).

In a recent meta-analysis of 35 studies, acupuncture significantly reduced
SBP by 7.47 mmHg and DBP by 4.22 mmHg.

The authors of this analysis conclude, however, that
the results are limited by methodological flaws in the studies.

They suggest further large-scale stud -
ies be done to confirm these results.

In my practice, I frequently use acupuncture to help reduce
stress.

I take blood pressures before and after treatment and on average notice drops of 2–3 mmHg
SPB and 1–2 mmHg DBP.

My personal belief is that acupuncture helps to reduce blood pressure
through stress-relieving qualities.

FASTING AND HYPERTENSION
Fasting has been shown to lower blood pressure and reduce the prevalence of coronary artery dis -
ease.87,88 In one study, 174 hypertensive adults participated in extended water-only fasting, which
averaged 10 to 11 days in length.

At the end of the study, 90% of the participants were normotensive
with an average reduction in SBP and DBP of 37 and 13 mmHg, respectively.

The greatest reduc -
tion in blood pressure occurred in those with stage III hypertension with an average reduction of
60/17 mmHg (systolic/diastolic).

This study suggests that medically supervised water-only fasting
is a safe and effective treatment for hypertension.88
One anecdotal case that made a lasting impression on my practice involved a 69-year-old male
with stage I/II hypertension.

Timothy asked me to supervise a 10-day water-only fast for his ele -
vated blood pressure, which was slowly creeping up into the 175/80 mmHg range.

While fasting, he
agreed to rest as much as possible allowing himself to venture into his garden for a couple of hours
each day.89 Timothy also agreed to be in close contact with me over the phone and through e-mail
to update me regularly about his condition.

After 5 days of fasting, his blood pressure dropped to 128/66 mmHg.

He wanted to continue with
the fast, and by the end of the 15th day (10 days of fasting and 5 days of proper food reintroduction)
his blood pressure had reached 100/55 mmHg.

During the fast, he experienced weight loss (14 lb)
and moderate to severe fatigue.

He also developed a mild anemia with lowered red blood cells,
hematocrit, and hemoglobin, which returned to normal 6 weeks post fast.

Timothy said “although
this fast lowered my blood pressure tremendously, it did lower my chi (energy), which took many
weeks to build again.”
Timothy returned again 1 year later with mildly elevated blood pressure (160/80 mmHg) and
commented that his blood pressure remained low throughout the year but started to slowly rise
about 6 months post fast.

This rise in blood pressure, he commented, was likely due to life stressors
as his diet (Paleolithic) and exercise (running 28 km/week) remained unchanged.

The life stressors
included taking on more housework, caring for his wife who has multiple sclerosis, and commuting
longer hours to visit his grandchildren.

He also suspects that rising blood pressure is related to aging.

I learned a valuable lesson from this experience; water-only fasting is an excellent treatment
option to lower blood pressure in highly motivated patients who desire nondrug approaches.

Remarkably, Timothy wants to fast again this upcoming spring.

Currently, I have him taking aged
garlic, CoQ10, fish oils, and magnesium to manage his elevated blood pressure.

If his blood pres -
sure does not decrease significantly using these nutraceuticals, I have given Timothy clearance for
a 5-day water-only fast in the spring or summer.

I feel a 5-day fast (compared to a 10-day fast) is
medically more appropriate and safe with his history of moderate to severe fatigue and development
of anemia.

GROUNDING AND HYPERTENSION
There is research emerging showing a positive cardiovascular benefit from connecting our bodies
to the surface of the earth.90 This technique is known as grounding or earthing, and it can improve
heart rate variability, reduce blood viscosity, lower nighttime cortisol, reduce pain, increase ζ poten -
tial, and increase parasympathetic activity.91–93 The simplest way to ground our bodies is to walk 192 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
barefoot in the grass.

For most of our existence, humans have walked barefoot or with conductive
footwear (e.g., leather) and have slept close to the earth.

With the introduction of rubber and plastic
sole shoes, however, people are rarely in contact with the earth.

When the skin touches the earth’s
electron rich surface, there is a free flow of negative charge into the body, which may help neutralize
free radicals or reactive oxygen species.

This may be a possible mechanism of action for the physi -
ological benefits attributed through grounding.

Although there are case reports of grounding lower -
ing blood pressure, more research needs to be done to suggest this as a treatment for hypertension.93
IMPORTANCE OF DETOXIFICATION IN SUPPORTING
THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
introduction
Considering the enormous toxin burden we are facing today, detoxification must become a way of
life or toxin accumulation will inadvertently affect our health and, more importantly, the health
of future generations.

Since the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of chemical fertilizers
and pesticides, the level of toxins present in air, water, and soil has skyrocketed to unprecedented
levels.

Heavy metals such as mercury, pesticides such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT),
and xenoestrogens such as phthalates found in plastics have infiltrated the environment and ulti -
mately our bodies.

The amount of chemicals used for agriculture alone has increased tremendously
over the last half decade, and some of these pesticides originally deemed as safe are proving to be
carcinogenic.94 This massive increase in environmental toxins has put tremendous strain on our
cell’s detoxification mechanisms and, consequently, toxins are being stored rather than properly
excreted.95–97
eFFects oF environ Mental toxins  on blood Pressure  and tHe cardiovascular  syste M
Many studies have looked at the effects of environmental toxins on blood pressure and CVD.

It
is known that heavy metals including mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and lead; cigarette smoke; and
pesticides can cause elevations in blood pressure.98,99 In one study looking at residents living near a
Monsanto chemical plant, those with high polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure had elevations
in SBP and DBP.

PCBs are manmade chemicals banned in the United States in 1979 due to their
high level of toxicity.

Although the exact mechanism of how PCBs affect blood pressure is unclear,
it is thought that they promote endothelial dysfunction through their proinflammatory nature.

PCBs
have been shown to induce oxidative stress in endothelial cells, which may be an underlying mecha -
nism for the development of atherosclerosis and hypertension.100 Sadly, PCBs are still showing up in
our food supply, and subsequently our bodies, as they continue to be dumped into the environment
and have a considerably long half-life (www.EPA.gov).

There is speculation that exposure to pesticides before birth may lead to greater susceptibility to
hypertension in adulthood.

DDT is a pesticide that was banned in the United States decades ago, but
it is still used worldwide for indoor malaria vector control, and as a pesticide in countries outside the
United States.

Today, DDT is still found in our soil and indoor air samples and continues to infiltrate
our bodies due to its long half-life and semivolatility.

In a birth cohort study following women into
their fifth decade of life, prenatals exposed to DDT were found to be at higher risk for developing
hypertension in adulthood.101 The implications of this study are enormous considering the plethora
of toxins found in prenatals today.

In a recent monumental study looking at environmental chemical levels in 268 pregnant women,
many chemicals known to have detrimental effects on health (e.g., carcinogenic compounds) were
positively identified.

In fact, some of these chemicals were found in 99%–100% of the samples
tested, and they included PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs), phe -
nols, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and 193 Naturopathic Medicine and the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease
perchlorate.102 According to research, exposure to PCBs,103 PBDEs, PFCs, and phthalates leads in an
increased risk of developing hypertension and other CVDs.104–107 When you consider the ubiquitous
nature of some of these chemicals such as phthalates, found in food and commercial plastics, it is
no surprise that exposure is increasing.

Considering the high level of prenatal exposure to chemicals in the womb, including the ones
listed earlier, physicians should implement detoxification into every parent’s preconception plan.

Detoxification treatments for future parents may develop into a specialty in the future.

Health
professionals must protect the unborn and newborn from the onslaught of chemicals in the envi -
ronment.

Ideally, detoxification should be prioritized as important as prenatal vitamins and folate
support.

My wife, also an ND, specializes in prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal care.

She has noticed
a staggering increase in infertility over the years, which she believes is largely due to environmental
toxicants and EMR exposure.

She has noticed
a staggering increase in infertility over the years, which she believes is largely due to environmental
toxicants and EMR exposure.

Treating disease does not begin once a symptom or disease develops
but starts before the fertilization of an egg.

The aforementioned Woodruff study elucidates that we are all vulnerable to toxin exposure even
before birth.

What happens to physiological processes in the body after years of exposure?

In one
study looking at the biological mechanisms of ambient air pollution on cardiovascular health, chronic
exposure to air pollution can increase rates of hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), CVD,
and thromboembolism.108–112 It is thought that particulate matter in air pollution activates inflamma -
tory pathways and hemostasis factors, produces reactive oxygen species due to elevated oxidative
stress, alters vascular tone, and decreases heart rate variability.108 Normally, healthy endothelial
cells secrete endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), which helps relax vascular smooth muscle.

Oxidative stress via exposure to particulate matter is thought to damage endothelial cells, thus pre -
venting the release of EDRF, which could contribute to systemic hypertension.

Additionally, white
blood cells adhere to the endothelium in response to tissue damage from oxidative stress, which sets
the stage for atherosclerosis to develop.

Atherosclerotic disease can be a sequela of hypertension.112
Research shows that reductions in particulate matter exposure over a few years does lower car -
diovascular mortality rates.110 Although many of us live in urban centers and are exposed to ever
increasing levels of particulate matter and air pollution, we can reduce our risk of CVD by reduc -
ing exposure.

The best way to reduce our exposure to toxins is avoidance of them in the first place.

Additionally, we can support the body’s detoxification pathways by helping to mobilize and elimi -
nate toxins that have been stored.

Working in concert together, the organ systems are able to effec -
tively remove toxins that we accumulate through the air, water, and soil.

Detoxification is a systematic lifestyle practice to enhance optimal functioning of body physi -
ology.113 It is absolutely necessary to detoxify on a daily basis considering the overabundance of
environmental toxins, and our increasing levels of exposure.

Toxins are natural and foreign sub -
stances found in the environment and are normal by-products of cell metabolism.

In the section
on “Reducing Toxic Exposure with Simple and Easy Interventions,” I present a general overview
of detoxification therapies and how they can be utilized every day to minimize toxin exposure and
accumulation.

Although the emphasis is on supporting overall health, additional benefits for the
cardiovascular system are discussed as well.

Any method to increase circulation will support detoxification pathways.

For basic detoxification
support, try walking at least 20 minutes each and every day.

If walking or light exercise is not an
option due to arthritis or injury, sauna therapy is another great method to increase circulation.

Finnish saunas have been studied the most because of their extensive use in Europe and popular -
ity in North America.

A Finnish sauna is usually constructed of wood walls and benches and uses
radiant heat to warm the air from 176°F to 194°F.90 Infrared saunas are another option for sauna 194 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
therapy.

They are typically heated to 110°F–130°F using infrared rays, and some patients fare better
in infrared saunas due to the lower temperature and humidity.

Both the Finnish and the infrared
saunas can be used for detoxification purposes.

Both the Finnish and the infrared
saunas can be used for detoxification purposes.

Saunas can improve hemodynamics through vasodilation of arteries, which can support the
mobilization of fat-soluble xenobiotics.114 Although there are few studies looking at heavy metal
removal with sauna therapy, we do know that mercury, cadmium, antimony, lead, and nickel are
released through sweat.

Sauna therapy can increase left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with
heart failure and increase peripheral circulation by 5%–10%, accounting for 50%–70% of cardiac
output.

Also, some studies report moderate reductions in blood pressure with sauna therapy.114,115
Most people, including cardiac patients with stable coronary heart disease or a history of myocar -
dial infarction, can safely use saunas.115 Contraindications include unstable angina, aortic stenosis,
and recent myocardial infarction.

Relative contraindications include heart arrhythmias and decom -
pensated heart failure.115 If the goal of sauna therapy is to lower blood pressure, only 15-  minute
sessions are recommended.

If optimizing detoxification is the primary outcome, longer sessions at
lower temperatures (140°F) are recommended.116 Remember to drink plenty of fluids and electro -
lytes before, during, and after treatment to help mobilize toxins and prevent dehydration.

Ginger/
yarrow tea is another drink commonly consumed before saunas to increase vasodilation, and thus
diaphoresis.

If saunas are not an option, hot yoga is another excellent form of detoxification therapy to pro -
mote toxin release via sweating.

Typically, rooms are heated at 104°F with 40%–60% humidity.

Practicing yoga in this temperature and humidity promotes profuse sweating and improves flexibil -
ity and strength.117 In a recent study on Bikram yoga, a popular form of hot yoga, older adults who
practiced three times per week for 90 minutes had improved insulin sensitivity by the end of the
8-week study.118 I recommend that patients go one to two times per week for general detoxification
and musculoskeletal support.

HigH-Fiber PHytonutrient -ricH diets oF organic  Fruits and vegetables
Eating a high-fiber predominately plant-based diet of organic vegetables and fruits provides protec -
tion for the cardiovascular system.119 Fruits and vegetables are loaded with antioxidants, vitamins,
and minerals, which can neutralize free radical stress, and contain high levels of fiber to move
toxins out of the digestive tract.

The average American consumes 11–18 g of fiber a day,120 but we
should consume greater than 50 g/day to maintain optimal colon health.

Eating a combination of
raw and cooked vegetables is best.

If buying organic foods is not an option, at the very least try
to avoid the “dirty dozen” fruits and vegetables known to have higher levels of pesticides: celery,
peaches, strawberries, apples, hot peppers, sweet bell peppers, nectarines, spinach, cherry toma -
toes, potatoes, cherries, and grapes.

Avoiding these dirty dozen foods will decrease your pesticide
exposure tremendously.

The fruits and vegetables with the lowest levels of pesticide residues include onion, avocado,
sweet corn, pineapple, mango, sweet peas, asparagus, kiwi, cabbage, eggplant, cantaloupe, mush -
rooms, papaya, grapefruit, and sweet potato.

You can print out a handy, wallet-sized chart of the
least and most toxic fruits and vegetables at http://www.foodnews.org/fulllist.php.

The dirty dozen
can fluctuate over time, so it is a good idea to update your list regularly.

More useful information
about the Environmental Working Group, which strives to educate the public about environmental
toxicants, may be found at www.ewg.org and www.foodnews.org.

Children who eat organic fruits and vegetables have lower detectable levels of organophos -
phorus pesticides in their urine.

This finding came out from a study conducted in Mercer Island,

This finding came out from a study conducted in Mercer Island,
Washington.

Children were fed conventional foods for 4 days, then all organic foods for 5 days,
and then again conventional foods for 6 days.

Malathion and chlorpyrifos were the organophospho -
rus pesticides detected in daily urine samples.

Median levels of these two pesticides significantly 195 Naturopathic Medicine and the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease
dropped to nondetectable levels immediately after the introduction of the organic diets and remained
nondetectable until the conventional foods were reintroduced again.121
Consuming organic fruits and vegetables is important because pesticides may damage the
cardiovascular system.

Pesticides including organophosphates have been shown to induce lipid
peroxidation, stimulate free radical production, and disturb the total antioxidant capability of
the body.122 In a study where rats were exposed to varying levels of the organophosphate pesti -
cide chlorpyrifos (the same pesticide tested for in the aforementioned Washington study), blood
pressure elevations were recorded and strongly correlated with increasing doses of the pesticide.

The authors of this study propose that chlorpyrifos, which is an irreversible acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor, causes cholinergic stimulation.123 Acute central nervous system stimulation can lead to
elevations in SBP and DBP.

liver and gastrointestinal  suPPortive  Foods and botanical  Medicines
We can alleviate the burden that toxins put on our cardiovascular system by supporting two very
important elimination pathways (organs): the liver and gastrointestinal tract.

The liver is responsible
for metabolizing drugs, toxins, hormones, and other endogenous and exogenous substances into
metabolites that are then excreted through the skin, kidneys, or gastrointestinal tract.

Any substance
(food, vitamin, nutraceutical, etc.)

that supports liver detoxification pathways will enhance removal
of toxins.

Once these toxins enter the small intestine, they need support getting out properly, and
this is where a healthy gastrointestinal tract comes into play.

There is a saying in medicine that when
in doubt treat the liver and gastrointestinal tract; if detoxification pathways are impaired, the body
literally becomes too toxic to function optimally.

There are various foods that you can eat on a daily basis to support the liver and gastrointestinal
tract.

Root vegetables (artichokes, carrots, dandelion, and beets), sulfur-containing foods (eggs,
garlic, and onions), water-soluble fibers (pears, oat bran, apples, and beans), and cabbage family
vegetables (broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cabbage) all optimize healthy liver and intestine func -
tion.

You can also juice many of the aforementioned fruits and vegetables, which also aids in the
detoxification process by supplying live enzymes.

Avoiding sugary foods will also help your body
detox, which may help you think twice about reaching for that midafternoon cookie.

Instead, eat a
handful of raisins and almonds, or dip an apple slice into a freshly made hummus.

Other foods that you should try to implement into your diet to support the liver and gastrointes -
tinal tract include fermented foods and drinks.

Fermented foods and drinks include kimchi, sau -
erkraut, pickled ginger, beet kvass, kombucha, miso, tempeh, natto, yogurt, raw cheese, and kefir.

There are many other food and drinks including high-quality beers and wines that are considered
fermented.

Fermented food and drinks supply a natural source of probiotics to the gastrointestinal
tract, which help to digest foods, improve immune function, and prevent “bad” microorganisms
(Escherichia coli ) from causing infection.

Many cultures around the world consume fermented
foods and drinks with every meal.

Many cultures around the world consume fermented
foods and drinks with every meal.

When looking for a high-quality fermented food or drink, check
to see if excess heating has been used, which destroys the natural fermentation process.

I highly
recommend making these foods and drinks at home, as quality is increased with smaller produc -
tion.

Check out the book Wild Fermentation  by Sandor Ellix Katz for more information and home
recipes.

There are many botanical medicines that support liver function and therefore augment liver
detoxification pathways.

Some of these botanicals include milk thistle seed, schisandra seed, dan -
delion root, burdock root, turmeric root, and artichoke leaf.

These herbs can be ingested in foods,
tinctures, teas, or pills.

They have different functions (e.g., hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and alter -
ative), depending on how they are prescribed, and can be combined in formulas to create synergistic
effects.

Generally, they are very safe in lower doses; however, consult with an experienced practi -
tioner before using these botanicals.196 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
sKin brusHing
To improve the functioning of the skin and lymphatic system, try incorporating skin brushing into
a daily routine.

Skin brushing has been practiced in many cultures over the years to improve skin
hygiene.

By keeping the skin free from dry, dead skin cells, waste removal from the body is greatly
enhanced, blood flow is increased, and buildup of bacteria is decreased.

The best time to skin brush
is before a shower or before bed.

Using a natural vegetable bristle or loofah brush, start at the feet
using gentle, quick strokes and move upward toward the heart covering most of the body.

This is
the direction of lymph and venous blood flow.

It is completely normal for the skin to feel slightly
tingly, but be sure to avoid harsh brushing and brushing over open wounds, the face, or over any
lymphatic malignancies.

castor  oil aPPlications
One of the most important detoxification treatments that I offer to my patients is the castor oil
pack.124 Castor oil is an anti-inflammatory agent that when absorbed through the skin promotes
increased circulation, decreased constipation symptoms, elimination of toxins, and stimulation of
white blood cells.125–127 The castor oil pack should be done five to seven times a week for a month
to promote optimal detoxification of the liver, intestines, and lymphatic system.

It can be done
whenever you are feeling run down, or want to improve the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract
and immune system.

It is now known that approximately 60%–70% of our immune system is found
around our intestines as a vast network of gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT).

According to
one study looking at the immunomodulation effects of topical castor oil, a 2-hour application led to
a significant increase in blood lymphocytes.125
The easiest method to use a castor oil pack is to apply about 1 to 2 tbsp of castor oil to a flannel
cloth and place it on the abdomen and upper right quadrant so that the oil is in contact with the skin.

The castor oil should form a thin layer on the skin and not be dripping.

Then place an old towel on top
(castor oil can stain) and a hot water bottle over the towel to help drive the castor oil into the skin.

A hot
water bottle or other heating device is not required, but most people report feeling more relaxed when
it is used.

The heat should be strong enough that you feel a warm gentle heat on your abdomen, but
avoid burning.

During the next 45–60 minutes, try meditating, reading, or listening to calming music.

This is a great opportunity to devote a small part of your day to healing and relaxing.

You can
even go to sleep!

The castor oil pack affects many systems of the body, and you may feel like you
sleep better, have more energy, or experience more regular bowel movements.

You can
even go to sleep!

The castor oil pack affects many systems of the body, and you may feel like you
sleep better, have more energy, or experience more regular bowel movements.

After the castor oil
pack is completed, you can either wash off the excess oil with water and soap or baking soda, or
leave it on your skin.

Store the flannel cloth in a plastic bag and use repeatedly, applying less castor
oil as the cloth becomes more saturated with frequent use.

contrast  Hydrot HeraPy
Contrast hydrotherapy has been used for centuries to improve circulation, immune system function,
and remove toxins.128–130 Ever visit a spa and notice that a cold pool for immersion is usually next
to a sauna or whirlpool?

When the body is exposed to heat, blood vessels vasodilate to improve
nutrient/waste transfer and blood flow.

This is what causes us to sweat.

Quickly jumping into a cold
plunge causes vasoconstriction, which drives the oxygen-rich blood to the vital organs.

Research
shows that hydrotherapy tonifies the immune system by increasing the migration of white blood
cells.131 In one study, men who were submerged in warm baths or exercised prior to cold immersion
showed an increase in the migration of leukocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes.132 Most of us do
not have cold plunges in our homes, but contrast hydrotherapy can be practiced in the shower.

After
taking a warm shower, try ending with a 30-second cool water spray starting with the extremities
and ending with the abdominal area and low back.197 Naturopathic Medicine and the Prevention and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease
tHeraPeutic Fasting
One of the most ancient, powerful, and cost-effective methods of cleansing is fasting.

Historically,
religious and spiritual people have fasted to cleanse the body, mind, and spirit of impurities.133 From
a purely physical perspective, fasting enables the body to rest and work more efficiently.

Fasting
induces metabolic and hormonal changes by improving insulin sensitivity, enhancing enzyme sta -
tus, recalibrating taste sensation (e.g., salt), promoting weight loss, and reducing leaky gut.

Though
fasting is indicated for loss of appetite, acute illness, and chronic illness; to accelerate healing and
change behaviors (e.g., quit smoking); and for its psycho-spiritual effect, not everyone is a candidate
for fasting.88 Please consult with a health-care professional before choosing to do a fast.

ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION
There is another environmental toxicant that is slowly emerging as a threat to our health, and it is
not a heavy metal, chemical, or pesticide.133 This invisible toxin is the increasing expansion and use
of wireless technologies that emit radio frequencies.

EMR, or wireless radiation, is a frequency that
we cannot see, feel, hear, taste, or smell, and as such we do not realize when we are exposed.

These
devices include cell phones and cell phone antennas, cordless phones, Wi-Fi routers, microwave
ovens, smart meters, baby monitors, tablets, computers, and any other device that utilizes wire -
less technology.

Unfortunately, radio frequency devices were not rigorously tested before market
release, and some say our safety regulations are obsolete.

There are many harmful nonthermal biological effects caused by wireless radiation that have
emerged via recent research, but standards continue to stay the same.134 For instance, we do know
that wireless radiation induces oxidative damage,135 but the magnitude of oxidative damage caused
by radio frequencies is unknown.

Also, there have been no long-term studies on radio frequency
safety or analysis of the cumulative effect of using multiple wireless technologies at once over an
extended period of time.

The best way to reduce exposure to these technologies is to avoid them.

The best way to reduce exposure to these technologies is to avoid them.

This entails talking on cellular speakerphone, using wires instead of wireless whenever possible
(i.e., corded phone or Ethernet) and refusing to use a smart meter for your electrical utility meter.

There are radio frequency–protective clothing, fabrics, and devices available as well if wireless use
is necessary.

Be particularly careful if you are pregnant or carrying a young one as their tiny bodies and
developing brains are more susceptible to radiation exposure.136 Remember, we should not sacrifice
safety for convenience, and the effect of lifelong exposure to these frequencies is unknown.

Any
couple trying to conceive should avoid using wireless devices.

A recent study showed that men
who use laptops with Wi-Fi had a significant decrease in sperm motility and an increase in sperm
DNA fragmentation.137,138 Since Wi-Fi is currently used in many homes and businesses, avoidance
is tricky, but it can be done.

It should be noted that many public libraries in France have removed
Wi-Fi due to health concerns, and Germany has warned its citizens to use corded connections
(Ethernet) as often as possible.

SUMMARY
It is important to remember that although we live in a toxic world where exposure to chemicals,
industry by-products, and pollution is common, our bodies are intelligently designed to protect us
from toxin exposure.

We can optimize organ function and detoxification mechanisms by following
these simple-to-implement strategies: drink plenty of filtered water; consciously breathe; exercise;
encourage sweating; eat foods that are low in pesticide residue, are fermented, and support the liver
and gastrointestinal tract; apply castor oil packs; practice skin brushing and hydrotherapy; and
reduce wireless radiation exposure.

Try incorporating some or all of these suggestions into your
daily regimen and see how you feel.198 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
A word of caution when starting to detoxify is you may feel worse before you feel better, particu -
larly if you have a history of toxin exposure.

Moreover, when beginning to eat healthier foods the
body may begin detoxifying more efficiently, so detoxification reactions are common.

Symptoms
may include headaches, nausea, joint pain, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, anxiety, depression, and
changes in bowel habits.

These reactions may happen because you are eliminating toxins that have
been stored in your body for years.

Many techniques and treatments discussed here minimize adverse reactions by optimizing the
body’s detoxification pathways.

Special care and support need to be given to the key organs of
elimination, which include the liver, intestines, lungs, kidneys, skin, and lymphatic system.

After
implementing some of the aforementioned detoxification strategies for a couple of weeks or months,
you may notice increased vitality, improved sleep and energy, elevated mood, and fewer signs and
symptoms.

These changes indicate that your organs of elimination are functioning well and prop -
erly detoxifying your body.

It may take some time and effort to feel better though.

For many NDs,
detoxification therapies are one of the most important modalities offered to patients.

If we could
visibly see what we are exposed to on a daily basis, detoxification would become standard of care
for every person on this planet.

CONCLUSION
In medicine, there are many ways to achieve an outcome.

I find that practicing individualized medi -
cine is the foundation for optimal health.

Every patient is different due to genetics, diet and lifestyle
choices, comorbidities, stress, overall toxic burden, gender, age, and other factors.

226,"Chunk 226:
Empower your
patients by increasing their awareness and consciousness about health.

Teach your patients about
healthy diet and lifestyle measures, mind–body medicines including breathing and meditation, nutra -
ceuticals, botanical medicines, therapeutic fasting, detoxification techniques, and grounding.

All of
these modalities will strengthen your practice as more and more people are searching for nonphar -
macological ways to stay healthy.

Remember to spend time with your patients, ask questions about
their current and past health, listen to their concerns, and investigate the true cause of their suffering.

damage the endothelium lead to endothelial dysfunction (ED) and may induce hypertension and
other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).

Hypertension may be a hemodynamic marker of injured
endothelium and vascular smooth muscle related to finite responses of inflammation, oxidative
stress and immune dysfunction of the arteries leading to ED, vascular and cardiac smooth muscle
dysfunction, loss of arterial elasticity with reduced arterial compliance, and increased systemic
vascular resistance.

Hypertension is a consequence of the interaction of genetics and environment.

Macronutrients and micronutrients are crucial in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) and subse -
quent target organ damage (TOD).

Nutrient–gene interactions, subsequent gene expression, epi -
genetics, oxidative stress, inflammation, and autoimmune vascular dysfunction have positive or
negative influences on vascular biology in humans.

Endothelial activation with ED and vascular
smooth muscle dysfunction (VSMD) initiate and perpetuate essential hypertension.

In my opinion, macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies are very common in the general
population and may be even more common in patients with hypertension and CVD due to genetics,
environmental causes, and prescription drug use.

These deficiencies will have an enormous impact
on present and future cardiovascular health outcomes such as hypertension, myocardial infarc -
tion (MI), stroke, and renal disease.

The diagnosis and treatment of these nutrient deficiencies will
reduce BP and improve vascular health, ED, vascular biology, and cardiovascular events.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Epidemiology underscores the etiologic role of diet and associated nutrient intake in hyperten -
sion.

The transition from Paleolithic diet to our modern diet of high sugar and carbohydrate foods
has produced an epidemic of nutritionally related diseases (Table 9.1).

The human genetic makeup is 99.9% that of our Paleolithic ancestors, yet our nutritional,  vitamin,

stress from radical oxygen species (ROS) and radical nitrogen species (RNS); and  inflammatory
mediators such as cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), cytokines, signaling molecules, and  autoimmune
vascular dysfunction of T cells and B cells contribute to the higher incidence of hypertension and

Poor nutrition, coupled with obesity
and a sedentary lifestyle, has resulted in an exponential increase in nutritionally related diseases.

In particular, the high Na+/K+ ratio of modern diets has contributed to hypertension, CVAs, CHD,
MI, CHF, and renal disease,3,10 as have the relatively low intake of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs), increase in ω-6 PUFAs, saturated fat, and trans fatty acids.11
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Vascular biology assumes a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of hypertension and car -
diovascular TOD.1 Oxidative stress (ROS and RNS), inflammation (increased expression of redox-
sensitive proinflammatory genes, CAMs, and recruitment migration and infiltration of circulating
cells), and autoimmune vascular dysfunction (T cells and B cells) are the primary pathophysiologic
and functional mechanisms that induce vascular disease1,12–14 (Figure 9.5).

All three of these are
closely interrelated and establish a deadly combination that leads to ED, vascular smooth muscle
and cardiac dysfunction, hypertension, vascular disease, atherosclerosis, and CVD.

Hypertension
is not a disease but the correct and chronically dysregulated response with an exaggerated outcome
of the infinite insults to the blood vessel with subsequent environmental–genetic expression pat -
terns and downstream disturbances in which the vascular system is the innocent bystander.

This
becomes a maladaptive vascular response that was initially intended to provide vascular defense to

Immune vascular dysfunction.

Stimulation of angiotensin receptor type 1
(ATR1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and toll-like receptor (TLR), and direct stimula -
tion of T cells on the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle lead to immune dysfunction, inflammation,
and oxidative stress.210 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
the endothelial insults.1,13–15 Hypertension is a vasculopathy characterized by ED, structural remod -
eling, vascular inflammation, increased arterial stiffness, reduced distensibility, and loss of elastic -
ity.13 These insults are biomechanical (BP, pulse pressure, blood flow, oscillatory flow, turbulence,
augmentation, pulse wave velocity, and reflected waves) and biohumoral or biochemical, which
includes all the nonmechanical causes such as metabolic, endocrine, nutritional, toxic, infectious,
and other etiologies1 (Figure 9.6).

In addition to the very well-established connections for endocrine
and nutritional causes of hypertension, toxins and infections also increase BP.16–20 Various toxins
such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic, and iron also increase
BP and CVD.16,17 Numerous microbial organisms have been implicated in hypertension and CHD.18–
20 All of these insults lead to impaired microvascular structure and function, which manifests clini -
cally as hypertension.12–14 The level of BP may not give an accurate indication of the microvascular
involvement and impairment in hypertension.

Hypertensive patients have abnormal microvascula -
ture in the form of inward eutrophic remodeling of the small resistance arteries leading to impaired
vasodilatory capacity, increased vascular resistance, increased media to lumen ratio, decreased
maximal organ perfusion, and reduced flow reserve, especially in the heart with decreased coronary
flow reserve (CFR).12–14 Significant functional and structural microvascular impairment occurs even
before the BP begins to rise in normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents evidenced by ED,
impaired vasodilation, forearm vascular resistance, diastolic dysfunction, increased left ventricu -
lar mass index, increased septal and posterior wall thickness, and left ventricular hypertrophy.12,15
Thus, the cellular processes underlying the vascular perturbations constitute a vascular phenotype
of hypertension that may be determined by early life programming and imprinting, which is com -
pounded by vascular aging.12–14

Stimulation of angiotensin receptor type 1 increases the production of
superoxide anion, which neutralizes NO and also forms additional downstream radical oxygen species (ROSs)
and radical nitrogen species (RNSs) that increase vascular oxidative stress.211 Nutrition and Nutraceutical Supplements for the Treatment of Hypertension
oxidative  stress
Oxidative stress, with an imbalance between ROS and RNS and the antioxidant defense mecha -
nisms, contributes to the etiology of hypertension in animals21 and humans.22,23 ROSs and RNSs are
generated by multiple cellular sources, including NADPH oxidase, mitochondria, xanthine oxidase,
uncoupled endothelium-derived NO synthase (U-eNOS), cyclo-oxygenase, and lipo-oxygenase.22
Superoxide anion is the predominant ROS produced by these tissues, which neutralizes NO and also
leads to downstream production of other ROSs (Figure 9.3).

Hypertensive patients have impaired
endogenous and exogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms,24 an increased plasma oxidative stress,
and an exaggerated oxidative stress response to various stimuli.24,25 Hypertensive subjects also
have lower ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), lower vitamin C levels, and increased plasma
8-isoprostanes correlate with both an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood
pressure (DBP).

Various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that codify for anti -
oxidant enzymes are directly related to hypertension.26 These include NADPH oxidase, xanthine
oxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) 3, catalase, GPx 1 (glutathione peroxidase), and thioredoxin.

Antioxidant deficiency and excess free radical production have been implicated in human hyperten -
sion in numerous epidemiologic, observational, and interventional studies24,25,27 (Figure 9.7).

ROSs
directly damage endothelial cells; degrade NO; influence eicosanoid metabolism; oxidize low-
density lipoprotein (LDL), lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, DNA, and organic molecules; increase
catecholamines; damage the genetic machinery; and influence gene expression and transcription
factors.1,22–25 The interrelations of neurohormonal systems, oxidative stress, and CVD are shown in
Figure 9.8.

The increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and autoimmune vascular dysfunction in
human hypertension result from a combination of increased generation of ROSs and RNSs, an exac -
erbated response to ROSs and RNSs, and a decreased antioxidant reserve.24–29 Increased oxidative
stress in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) enhances glutamatergic excitatory inputs and
attenuates γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibitory inputs to the RVLM, which contributes to
increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity from the paraventricular nucleus.30 Activation
of AT1R in the RVLM increases NADPH oxidase and increases oxidative stress and superoxide

anion and increases SNS outflow causing an imbalance of SNS/parasympathetic nervous system
(PNS) activity with elevation of BP, increased heart rate, and alterations in heart rate variability and
heart rate recovery time, which can be blocked by AT1R blockers.30,31
inFlaMMation
The link between inflammation and hypertension has been suggested in both cross-sectional
and longitudinal studies.32 Increases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP) as well as
other inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1B (IL-1B), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necro -
sis factor- α (TNF- α), and chronic leukocytosis occur in hypertension and hypertension-related
TOD, such as increased carotid intimal medial thickness.33 HS-CRP predicts future cardiovascular
events.32,33 Elevated HS-CRP is both a risk marker and a risk factor for hypertension and CVD.34,35
Increases in HS-CRP of over 3 μg/mL  may increase BP in just a few days, which is directly pro -
portional to the increase in HS-CRP.34,35 Nitric oxide and eNOS are inhibited by HS-CRP.34,35
AT2R, which normally counterbalances AT1R, is downregulated by HS-CRP.34,35 A-II upregulates
many of the cytokines, especially IL-6, CAMs, and chemokines, by activating nuclear factor κB
(NFκB) leading to vasoconstriction.

These events, along with the increases in oxidative stress and
endothelin-1, elevate BP.32
autoi MMune dysFunction
Innate and adaptive immune responses are linked to hypertension and hypertension-induced CVD
through at least three mechanisms: cytokine production, central nervous system (CNS) stimulation,
and renal damage.

This includes salt-sensitive hypertension with increased renal inflammation as a
result of T cell imbalance, dysregulation of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, and chronic leukocytosis
with increased neutrophils and reduced lymphocytes.36–38 Leukocytosis, especially increased neu -
trophils and decreased lymphocyte count, increases BP in blacks by 6/2 mmHg in the highest versus
the lowest tertile.38 Macrophages and various T-cell subtypes regulate BP, invade the arterial wall,
activate TLRs, and induce autoimmune vascular damage.38,39 A-II activates immune cells (T cells,
macrophages, and dendritic cells) and promotes cell infiltration into target organs.39 CD4 + T lym -
phocytes express AT1R and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- γ (PPAR γ) receptors and
release TNF- α, interferons, and interleukins within the vascular wall when activated39 (Figure 9.5).

caused by A-II.39 Hypertensive patients have significantly higher TLR 4 mRNA in monocytes com -
pared to normals.40 Intensive reduction in BP to SBP less than 130 mmHg versus SBP to only
140 mmHg lowers the TLR 4 more.40 A-II activates the TLR expression leading to inflammation
and activation of the innate immune system.

When TLR 4 is activated, there is downstream macro -
phage activation and migration and increase in  metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9), vascular remodeling,
collagen accumulation in the artery, left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH) , and cardiac fibrosis.40 The
autonomic nervous system is critical in either increasing or decreasing immune dysfunction and
inflammation.41 Efferent cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathways via the vagal nerve innervate the
spleen, nicotine acetylcholine receptor subunits, and cytokine-producing immune cells to influence
vasoconstriction and BP.41 Local CNS inflammation or ischemia may mediate vascular inflamma -
tion and hypertension.39
Aldosterone is associated with increased adaptive immunity and autoimmune responses with
CD4 +T cell activation and Th 17 polarization with increased IL-17, transforming growth factor
(TGF)- β, and TNF- α, which modulate over 30 inflammatory genes.42,43 Increased serum aldoste -
rone is an independent risk factor for CVD and CHD through nonhemodynamic effects as well as
through increased BP.42,43 Blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart, brain, blood vessels,
and immune cells reduces cardiovascular risk even with the persistence of hypertension.42,43
TREATMENT
Many of the natural compounds in food, certain nutraceutical supplements, vitamins, antioxidants,
or minerals function in a similar fashion to a specific class of antihypertensive drugs.

Although the
potency of these natural compounds may be less than that of the antihypertensive drugs, when used
in combination with other nutrients and nutraceutical supplements, the antihypertensive effect is
additive or synergistic.

Table 9.2 summarizes these natural compounds into the major antihyper -
tensive drug classes such as diuretics, β-blockers, central α agonists, direct vasodilators, calcium
channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs), and direct renin inhibitors (DRIs).

dasH d iets
The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) I and II diets conclusively demonstrated
significant reductions in BP in borderline and stage I hypertensive patients.44,45 In DASH I, untreated
hypertensive subjects with SBP < 160 mmHg and DBP = 80–95 mmHg were placed on one of three
diets for 4 weeks, control diet, fruit and vegetable diet (F +V), and combined diet that added F +V
and low-fat dairy.44 DASH II added progressive sodium restriction in each group.45 The control diet
consisted of sodium at 3 g/day; potassium, magnesium, and calcium at 25% of the U.S. average;
macronutrients at the U.S. average of 4 servings per day; a sodium to potassium ratio of 1.7; and fiber
at 9 g/day.

The F +V diet increased the potassium, magnesium, and calcium to 75%; macronutrients
to greater than the U.S. average; a sodium to potassium ratio of 0.7; 31 g of fiber; and 8.5 servings of
fruits and vegetables per day.

The combined diet was similar to the F +V diet but added low-fat dairy.

At 2 weeks, the BP was decreased by 10.7/5.2 mmHg in the hypertensive patients in DASH I and by
11.5/6.8 mmHg in the hypertensive patients in DASH II.

These reductions persisted as long as the

These reductions persisted as long as the
patients were on the diet.

The DASH diet increases plasma renin activity (PRA) and serum aldo -
sterone levels in response to the BP reductions.46,47 The mean increase in PRA was 0.37 ng·mL/h .47
The A allele of G46A had a greater BP reduction and blunted PRA and aldosterone.

The AA geno -
type had the best response, and the GG genotype had no response.

Adding an ARB, an ACEI, or
a DRI improved BP response to the DASH diet in the GG group due to blockade of the increase in
PRA.

A low-sodium DASH diet decreases oxidative stress (urine F2-isoprostanes), improves vas -
cular function (augmentation index), and lowers BP in salt-sensitive subjects.48 In addition, plasma
nitrite increased and pulse wave velocity decreased at week 2 on the DASH diet.49214 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine

Sodium (Na+) Reduction
The average sodium intake in the United States is 5,000 mg/day, with some areas of the country
consuming 15,000–20,000 mg/day.50 However, the minimal requirement for sodium is probably
about 500 mg/day.50 Epidemiological, observational, and controlled clinical trials demonstrate
that an increased sodium intake is associated with higher BP as well as an increased risk for
CVD, CVA, LVH, CHD, MI, renal insufficiency, proteinuria, and overactivity of the SNS.1,50 A
reduction in sodium intake in hypertensive patients, especially the salt-sensitive patients, will
significantly lower BP by 4–6/2 to 3 mmHg that is proportional to the degree of sodium restric -
tion and may prevent or delay hypertension in high-risk patients and reduce future cardiovascular
events.51–53
Salt sensitivity (≥10% increase in mean arterial pressure ( MAP)  with salt loading) occurs in
about 51% of hypertensive patients and is a key factor in determining the cardiovascular, cerebro -
vascular, renal, and BP responses to dietary salt intake.54 Cardiovascular events are more com -
mon in the salt-sensitive patients than in the salt-resistant ones, independent of BP.55 An increased
sodium intake has a direct positive correlation with BP and the risk of CVA and CHD.56 The risk TABLE 9.2 ( Continued  )

is independent of BP for CVA with a relative risk of 1.04–1.25 from the lowest to the highest quar -
tile.56 In addition, patients will convert to a nondipping BP pattern with increases in nocturnal BP
as the sodium intake increases.56
Increased sodium intake has a direct adverse effect on endothelial cells.57–61 Sodium promotes
cutaneous lymphangiogenesis; increases endothelial cell stiffness; reduces size, surface area, vol -
ume, cytoskeleton, deformability, and pliability; reduces eNOS and NO production; and increases
asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA), oxidative stress, and TGF- β.

All of these abnormal vas -
cular responses are increased in the presence of aldosterone.57–61 These changes occur indepen -
dent of BP and may be partially counteract by dietary potassium.57–61 The endothelial cells act
as vascular salt sensors.62 Endothelial cells are targets for aldosterone, which activate epithelial
sodium channels and have a negative effect on the release of NO and on endothelial function.

The
mechanical stiffness of the cell plasma membrane and the submembranous actin network (endo -
thelial glycocalyx) (“shell”) serve as a “firewall” to protect the endothelial cells and are regulated
by serum sodium, potassium, and aldosterone within the physiological range.62 Changes in shear
stress–dependent activity of the endothelial NO synthase located in the caveolae regulate the vis -
cosity in this shell.62 High plasma sodium gelates the shell of the endothelial cell, whereas the shell
is fluidized by high potassium.

These communications between extracellular ions and intracel -
lular enzymes occur at the plasma membrane barrier, whereas 90% of the total cell mass remains
uninvolved in these changes.

Blockade of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with spironolac -
tone (100%) or amiloride (84%) minimizes or stops many of these vascular endothelial responses
and increases NO.60,63 Nitric oxide release follows endothelial nanomechanics and not vice versa
and membrane depolarization decreases vascular endothelial cell stiffness, which improves flow-
mediated nitric oxide–dependent vasodilation.64,65 In the presence of vascular inflammation and
increased HS-CRP , the effects of aldosterone on ENaC is enhanced further increasing vascular
stiffness and BP.66 High sodium intake also abolishes the AT2R-mediated vasodilation immedi -
ately, with complete abolition of endothelial vasodilation within 30 days.67 Thus, it is clear that
increased dietary sodium has adverse effects on the vascular system, BP, and CVD by altering the
endothelial glycocalyx, which is a negatively charged biopolymer that lines the blood vessels and
serves as a protective barrier against sodium overload, increased sodium permeability, and sodium-
induced TOD.68 Certain SNPs of salt-inducible kinase I (SIK1) that alter Na+/K+ ATPase  determine
sodium-induced hypertension and LVH.69
The sodium intake per day in hypertensive patients should be between 1500 and 2000 mg.

Sodium restriction improves BP reduction in those patients who are on pharmacological treatment,
and the decrease in BP is additive with restriction of refined carbohydrates.70,71 Reducing dietary
sodium intake may reduce damage to the brain, heart, kidney, and vasculature through mechanisms
dependent on the small BP reduction as well as those independent on the decreased BP.72–74
A balance of sodium with other nutrients, especially potassium, magnesium, and calcium,
is important not only in reducing and controlling BP but also in decreasing cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular events.3,70,71 An increase in the sodium to potassium ratio is associated with a sig -
nificantly increased risk of CVD and all-cause mortality.72 The Yanomamo Indians consume and
excrete only 1 mEq  of sodium in 24 hours and consume and excrete 152 mEq of potassium in 24
hours.75 The Na+ to K+ ratio is 1/152 and is associated with elevated PRA, but BP does not increase
with age.

At the age of 50 years, the average BP in the Yanomamo is 100–108/64–69 mmHg.75
Potassium
The average U.S. dietary intake of potassium (K+) is 45 mmol/day with a potassium to sodium (K+/
Na+) ratio of less than 1:2.10,73 The recommended intake of K+ is 4700 mg a day (120 mmol) with a
K+/Na+ ratio of about 4 to 5 to 1.10,73 Numerous epidemiological, observational, and clinical trials
have demonstrated a significant reduction in BP with increased dietary K+ intake in both normo -
tensive and hypertensive patients.10,73,76 The average BP reduction with a K+ supplementation of
60–120 mmol/day is 4.4/2.5 mmHg in hypertensive patients but may be as much as 8/4.1 mmHg 217 Nutrition and Nutraceutical Supplements for the Treatment of Hypertension
with 120 mmol/day (4700 mg).10,73,76–78 In hypertensive patients, the linear dose–response relation -
ship is 1.0 mmHg reduction in SBP and 0.52 mmHg reduction in DBP per 0.6 g/ day increase
in dietary potassium intake, which is independent of baseline dietary potassium ingestion.78 The
response depends on race (black > white) and sodium, magnesium, and calcium intakes .10 Those on
a higher sodium intake have a greater reduction in BP with potassium.10 Alteration of the K+/Na+
ratio to a higher level is important for both antihypertensive and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
effects.77,78 High potassium intake reduces the incidence of cardiovascular accidents (CHD and MI)
and CVAs independent of the BP reduction.10,73,76–78 There are also reductions in CHF, LVH, dia -
betes mellitus (DM), and cardiac arrhythmias.10,78 If the serum potassium is less than 4.0 mEq/dL,
there is an increased risk of CVD mortality, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and
CHF.10,78 Red blood cell potassium is a better indication of total body stores and CVD risk than
serum potassium.10 Gu et al.77 found that potassium supplementation at 60 mmol of KCl per day for
12 weeks significantly reduced SBP, –5.0 mm Hg (range: –2.13 to –7.88 mmHg) ( p < .001), in 150
Chinese men and women aged 35–64 years.

Potassium increases natriuresis, modulates baroreflex sensitivity, vasodilates, decreases the sen -
sitivity to catecholamines and A-II, increases sodium potassium ATPase and DNA synthesis in vas -
cular smooth muscle cells, and decreases SNS activity in cells with improved vascular function.10,78
In addition, potassium increases bradykinin and urinary kallikrein; decreases NADPH oxidase,
which lowers oxidative stress and inflammation; improves insulin sensitivity; decreases ADMA;
reduces intracellular sodium; and lowers the production of TGF- β.10,78
Each 1000 mg increase in potassium intake per day reduces all-cause mortality by approxi -

Potassium intake of 4.7 g/day is estimated to decrease CVA by 8%–15% and MI by
6%–11%.78 Numerous SNPs such as nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C (NR3C2), angiotensin
II type receptor (AGTR1), and hydroxysteroid 11 β-dehydrogenase (HSD11B1 and B2) determine
an individual’s response to dietary potassium intake.79 Each 1000 mg decrease in sodium intake
per day will decrease all-cause mortality by 20%.72,78 A recent analysis suggested a dose-related
response to CVA with urinary potassium excretion.80 There was a relative risk reduction ( RRR)
of CVA of 23% at 1.5–1.99 g, 27% at 2.0–2.49 g, 29% at 2.5–3 g, and 32% over 3 g/day of
potassium urinary excretion.80 The recommended daily dietary intake for patients with hyperten -
sion is 4.7–5.0 g of potassium and less than 1500 mg of sodium.10,78 Potassium in food or from
supplementation should be reduced or used with caution in those patients with renal impairment
or those on medications that increase renal potassium retention such as ACEI, ARB, DRI, and
serum aldosterone receptor antagonists (SARAs).10,78
Magnesium (Mg++)
A high dietary intake of magnesium of at least 500–1000 mg/day reduces BP in most of the
reported epidemiological, observational, and clinical trials, but the results are less consistent than
those seen with Na+ and K+.73,81 In most epidemiological studies, there is an inverse relationship
between dietary magnesium intake and BP.73,81,82 A study of 60 essential hypertensive subjects
given magnesium supplements showed a significant reduction in BP over an 8-week period docu -
mented by 24-hour ambulatory BP, home and office blood BP .73,81,82 The maximum reduction in
clinical trials has been 5.6/2.8 mmHg, but some studies have shown no change in BP.83 The com -
bination of high potassium and low sodium intake with increased magnesium intake had additive
antihypertensive effects.83 Magnesium also increases the effectiveness of all antihypertensive
drug classes.83
Magnesium competes with Na+ for binding sites on vascular smooth muscle and acts as a direct
vasodilator, like a CCB.

Magnesium increases prostaglandin E (PGE); regulates intracellular cal -
cium, sodium, potassium, and pH; increases nitric oxide; improves endothelial function; reduces
oxLDL; and reduces HS-CRP, TBxA2, A-II, and norepinephrine.

Magnesium also improves insu -
lin resistance, glucose, and MS; binds in a necessary cooperative manner with potassium, induc -
ing endothelial vasodilation (EVD)  and BP reduction; reduces CVD and cardiac arrhythmias; 218 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
decreases carotid IMT; lowers cholesterol; lowers cytokine production; inhibits NF κB; reduces oxi -
dative stress; and inhibits platelet aggregation to reduce thrombosis.73,81–87
Magnesium is an essential cofactor for the δ-6-desaturase enzyme that is the rate-limiting step
for the conversion of linoleic acid (LA) to γ-linolenic acid (GLA)73,81–86 needed for synthesis of the
vasodilator and platelet inhibitor prostaglandin E1 (PGE1).

Altered TRPM7 channels, which are the
transporters for magnesium, occur in many hypertensive patients.84
A meta-analysis of 241,378 patients with 6,477 strokes showed an inverse relationship of dietary
magnesium to the incidence of ischemic stroke.85 For each 100 mg of dietary magnesium intake,
ischemic stroke was decreased by 8%.

The proposed mechanism include inhibition of ischemia-
induced glutamate release, n-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA)  receptor blockade, CCB actions, mito -
chondrial calcium buffering, decrease in ATP depletion, and vasodilation of cerebral arteries.85 A
meta-analysis showed reductions in BP of 3–4 mmHg/2–3 mmHg in 22 trials of 1173 patients.88
Intracellular level of magnesium (RBC) is more indicative of total body stores and should be
measured in conjunction with serum and urinary magnesium.83 Magnesium may be supplemented
in doses of 500–1000 mg/day.

Magnesium formulations chelated to an amino acid may improve
absorption and decrease the incidence of diarrhea.83 Adding taurine at 1000–2000 mg/day will
enhance the antihypertensive effects of magnesium.83 Magnesium supplements should be avoided
or used with caution in patients with known renal insufficiency or in those taking medications that
induce magnesium retention.83
Calcium (Ca++)
Population studies show a link between hypertension and calcium,89 but clinical trials that admin -
istered calcium supplements to patients have shown inconsistent effects on BP.73,89 The heteroge -
neous responses to calcium supplementation have been explained by Resnick.90 This is the “ionic
hypothesis”90 of hypertension; CVD; and associated metabolic, functional, and structural disorders.

Calcium supplementation is not recommended at this time as an effective means to reduce BP.

Zinc (Zn++)
Low serum zinc levels in observational studies correlate with hypertension as well as CHD, T2DM,
hyperlipidemia, elevated lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), and increased 2-hour postprandial plasma insulin
levels and insulin resistance.91,92 Zinc is transported into cardiac and vascular muscle and other tis -
sues by metallothionein.93 Genetic deficiencies of metallothionein with intramuscular zinc deficien -
cies may lead to increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiomyocyte dysfunction,
and apoptosis with subsequent myocardial fibrosis, abnormal cardiac remodeling, heart disease,
heart failure, or hypertension.93 Intracellular calcium increases oxidative stress, which is reduced
by zinc.93
Bergomi et al.94 evaluated Zn++ status in 60 hypertensive subjects compared to 60 normotensive
control subjects.

An inverse correlation of BP and serum Zn++ was observed.

The BP was also
inversely correlated to a Zn++-dependent enzyme-lysyl oxidase activity.

Zn++ inhibits gene expres -
sion and transcription through NF κB and activated protein-1 (AP-1) and is an important cofactor
for SOD.91,93 These effects plus those on insulin resistance, membrane ion exchange, and renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and SNS effects may account for Zn++ antihypertensive
effects.91,93 Zinc intake should be 50 mg/day.1
Protein
Observational and epidemiological studies demonstrate a consistent association between a high
protein intake and a reduction in BP and incident BP.95,96 The protein source is an important fac -
tor in the BP effect, animal protein being less effective than nonanimal or plant protein, espe -
cially almonds.95–98 In the Inter-Salt Study of over 10,000 subjects, those with a dietary protein
intake 30% above the mean had a lower BP by 3.0/2.5 mmHg compared to those who were 30% 219 Nutrition and Nutraceutical Supplements for the Treatment of Hypertension
below the mean (81 vs. 44 g/day).95 However, lean or wild animal protein with less saturated fat
and more essential ω-3 fatty acids may reduce BP, lipids, and CHD risk.95,98 A meta-analysis con -
firmed these findings and also suggested that hypertensive patients and the elderly have the greatest
BP reduction with protein intake.96 Another meta-analysis of 40 trials with 3277 patients found
reductions in BP of 1.76/1.15 mmHg compared to carbohydrate intake ( p < .001).99 Both vegetable
and animal protein significantly and equally reduced BP at 2.27/1.26 mmHg and 2.54/.95 mmHg,
respectively.99 Increased dietary protein intake is inversely associated with risk for stroke in women
with hypertension.100 A randomized crossover study in 352 adults with prehypertension and stage
I hypertension found a significant reduction in SBP of 2.0 mmHg with soy protein and 2.3 mmHg
with milk protein compared to a high glycemic index diet over each of the 8-week treatment peri -
ods.101 There was a nonsignificant reduction in DBP.

Another parallel study over 4 weeks of 94
subjects with prehypertension and stage I hypertension found significant reductions on office BP of
4.9/2.7 mmHg in those given a combination of 25% protein intake versus the control group given
15% protein in an isocaloric manner.102 The protein consisted of 20% pea, 20% soy, 30% egg, and
30% milk protein isolate.102 The daily recommended intake of protein from all sources is 1.0–1.5 g/
kg body weight, varying with exercise level, age, renal function, and other factors.1,70,71
Fermented milk supplemented with whey protein concentrate significantly reduces BP in human
studies.103–107 Administration of 20 g/day of hydrolyzed whey protein supplement rich in bioactive
peptides significantly reduced BP over 6 weeks by 8.0 ± 3.2 mmHg in SBP and 5.5 ± 2.1 mm in
DBP.104 Milk peptides, which contain both caseins and whey proteins, are a rich source of ACEI
peptides.

Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro given at 5–60 mg/day have variable reductions in BP with an
average decrease in pooled studies of about 1.28–4.8/0.59–2.2 mmHg.71,101,105–108 However, several
recent meta-analyses did not show significant reductions in BP in humans.107,109 Powdered fermented
milk with Lactobacillus helveticus  given at 12 g/day significantly lowered BP by 11.2/6.5 mmHg
in 4 weeks in one study.105 Milk peptides are beneficial in treating MS.110 A dose–response study
showed insignificant reductions in BP.111 The clinical response is attributed to fermented milk’s
active peptides, which inhibit ACE.

Pins and Keenan112 administered 20 g of hydrolyzed whey protein to 30 hypertensive subjects
and noted a BP reduction of 11/7 mmHg compared to controls at 1 week, which was sustained
throughout the study.

Whey protein is effective in improving lipids, insulin resistance, glucose,
arterial stiffness, and BP.113 These data indicate that whey protein must be hydrolyzed to exhibit an
antihypertensive effect, and the maximum BP response is dose dependent.

Bovine casein–derived peptides and whey protein–derived peptides exhibit ACEI activity.103–112
These components include B-caseins, B-lg fractions, B2-microglobulin, and serum albumin.103–105,112
The enzymatic hydrolysis of whey protein isolates releases ACEI peptides.

Marine collagen peptides (MCPs) from deep sea fish have antihypertensive activity.114–116
A  double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 100 hypertensive subjects with diabetes who received
MCPs twice a day for 3 months had significant reductions in DBP and mean arterial pressure.114
Bonito protein ( Sarda orientalis ), from the tuna and mackerel family, has natural ACEI inhibitory
peptides and reduces BP by 10.2/7 mmHg at 1.5 g/day.115,117
Sardine muscle protein, which contains valyl-tyrosine (Val-Tyr), significantly lowers BP in
hypertensive subjects.118 Kawasaki et al.

treated 29 hypertensive subjects with 3 mg of Val-Tyr sar -
dine muscle concentrated extract for 4 weeks and lowered BP by 9.7/5.3 mmHg ( p < .05).118 Levels
of A-I increased as serum A-II and aldosterone decreased, indicating that Val-Tyr is a natural ACEI.

A similar study with a vegetable drink with sardine protein hydrolysates significantly lowered BP
by 8/5 mmHg in 13 weeks.119
Soy protein lowered BP in hypertensive patients in most studies101,120–129 Soy protein intake was
significantly and inversely associated with both SBP and DBP in 45,694 Chinese women consuming
25 g/day or more of soy protein over 3 years, and the association increased with age.120 The SBP
reduction was 1.9–4.9 mmHg lower and the DBP was 0.9–2.2 mmHg lower.120 However, random -
ized clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown mixed results on BP with no change in BP to 220 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
reductions of 7%–10% for SBP and DBP.123–127 The recent meta-analysis of 27 trials found a sig -
nificant reduction in BP of 2.21/1.44 mmHg.122 Some studies suggest improvement in endothelial
function, improved arterial compliance, reduction in HS-CRP and inflammation, ACEI activity,
reduction in sympathetic tone, diuretic action, and reduction in both oxidative stress and aldosterone
levels.

126,128,129 Fermented soy at about 25 g/day is recommended.

In addition to ACEI effects, protein intake may also alter catecholamine responses and induce a
natriuretic effect.118,119 Low protein intake coupled with low ω-3 fatty acid intake may contribute to
hypertension in animal models.130 The optimal protein intake, depending on level of activity, renal
function, stress, and other factors, is about 1.0–1.5 g/kg/day.1

l-Arginine
l-arginine and endogenous methylarginines are the primary precursors for the production of nitric
oxide (NO), which has numerous beneficial cardiovascular effects, mediated through conversion of
l-arginine to NO by eNOS.

Patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM, and atherosclerosis
have increased levels of HS-CRP and inflammation; increased microalbumin; low levels of ape -
lin (stimulates NO in the endothelium); increased levels of arginase (breaks down arginine); and
elevated serum levels of ADMA, which inactivates NO.131–135
Under normal physiological conditions, intracellular arginine levels far exceed the Km
(Michaelis–Menten constant [MMC]) of eNOS, which is less than 5 μmol.136 However, endogenous
NO formation is dependent on extracellular arginine concentration.136 The intracellular concentra -
tions of l-arginine are 0.1–3.8 mM in endothelial cells, whereas the plasma concentration of argi -
nine is 80–120 μM, which is about 20–25 times greater than the MMC.136,137 Despite this, cellular
NO formation depends on exogenous l-arginine, and this is the arginine paradox.

Renal arginine
regulates BP and blocks the formation of endothelin, reduces renal sodium reabsorption, and is a
potent antioxidant.136 The NO production in endothelial cells is closely coupled to cellular argi -
nine uptake, indicating that arginine transport mechanisms play a major role in the regulation of
NO-dependent function.

Exogenous arginine can increase renal vascular and tubular NO bioavail -
ability and influence renal perfusion, function, and BP.134 Molecular eNOS uncoupling may occur
in the absence of tetrahydrobiopterin, which stabilizes eNOS, leading to the production of ROS.137
Human studies in hypertensive and normotensive subjects of parenteral and oral administra -
tions of l-arginine demonstrate an antihypertensive effect as well as an improvement in coronary
artery blood flow and peripheral blood flow in peripheral artery disease ( PAD) .131,138–142 The BP
was decreased by 6.2/6.8 mmHg on 10 g/day of l-arginine when provided as a supplement or
though natural foods to a group of hypertensive subjects.138 Arginine produces a statistically and
biologically significant decrease in BP and improved metabolic effect in normotensive and hyper -
tensive humans that is similar in magnitude to that seen in the DASH I diet.138 Arginine given at
4 g/day also significantly lowered BP in women with gestational hypertension without proteinuria,
reduced the need for antihypertensive therapy, decreased maternal and neonatal complications, and
prolonged the pregnancy.139,140 The combination of arginine (1200 mg/day) and N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC) (600 mg bid) administered over 6  months to hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes
lowered SBP and DBP ( p < .05), increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C, decreased LDL-C
and oxLDL, reduced HS-CRP, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular cell adhesion mol -
ecule (VCAM), PAI-I, fibrinogen, and IMT.141 A study of 54 hypertensive subjects given arginine
4 g three times a day for 4 weeks had significant reductions in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring ( ABM) .142 A meta-analysis of 11 trials with 383 subjects administered arginine 4–24
g/day found average reduction in BP of 5.39/2.66 mmHg ( p < .001) in 4 weeks.143 Although these
doses of l-arginine appear to be safe, no long-term studies in humans have been published at this
time and there are concerns of a pro-oxidative effect or even an increase in mortality in patients 221 Nutrition and Nutraceutical Supplements for the Treatment of Hypertension
who may have severely dysfunctional endothelium, advanced atherosclerosis, CHD, ACS, or MI.144
In addition to the arginine–NO path, there exists a nitrate/nitrite pathway that is related to dietary
nitrates from vegetables, beetroot juice, and the DASH diet that are converted to nitrites by symbi -
otic, salivary, gastrointestinal (GI), and oral bacteria.145 Administration of beetroot juice or extract
at 500 mg/day will increase nitrites and lower BP; improve endothelial function; and increase cere -
bral, coronary, and peripheral blood flow.145
l-Carnitine and Acetyl- l-Carnitine
l-carnitine is a nitrogenous constituent of muscle primarily involved in the oxidation of fatty acids
in mammals.

Animal studies indicate that carnitine has both systemic antihypertensive effects and
antioxidant effects in the heart by upregulation of eNOS and PPAR γ; inhibition of RAAS; modula -
tion of NFkB; and downregulation of NOX2, NOX4, TGF- β, and CTGF, which reduces cardiac
fibrosis.146,147 Endothelial function, NO, and oxidative defense are improved, whereas oxidative
stress and BP are reduced.146–149
Human studies on the effects of l-carnitine and acetyl- l-carnitine are limited, with minimal to
no change in BP.150–156 In patients with MS, acetyl- l-carnitine at 1 g bid over 8 weeks improved dys -
glycemia and reduced SBP by 7–9 mm Hg, but DBP was significantly decreased only in those with
higher glucose.153 Low carnitine levels are associated with a nondipping BP pattern in T2DM.155
Carnitine has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and may be useful in the treatment of
essential hypertension, T2DM with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, CHF, and
cardiac ischemic syndromes.1,150–152,154 Doses of 2–3 g twice a day are recommended.

Taurine
Taurine is a sulfonic β-amino acid that is considered a conditionally essential amino acid, which is
not utilized in protein synthesis but is found free or in simple peptides with its highest concentra -
tion in the brain, retina, and myocardium.156  In cardiomyocytes, it represents about 50% of the free
amino acids and has the role of an osmoregulator, inotropic factor, and antihypertensive agent.157
Human studies have noted that essential hypertensive subjects have reduced urinary taurine as
well as other sulfur amino acids.1,156,157 Taurine lowers BP, systemic vascular resistance ( SVR) , and
HR; decreases arrhythmias, CHF symptoms, and SNS activity; increases urinary sodium and water
excretion; increases atrial natriuretic factor; improves insulin resistance; increases NO; and improves
endothelial function.

Taurine also decreases A-II, PRA, aldosterone, SNS activity, plasma norepineph -
rine, and plasma and urinary epinephrine; lowers homocysteine; improves insulin sensitivity, kinins,
and acetyl choline responsiveness; decreases intracellular calcium and sodium; lowers response to
β-receptors; has antioxidant, anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-inflammatory activities; decreases IMT
and arterial stiffness; and may protect from risk of CHD.1,156–162 A lower urinary taurine is associ -
ated with increased risk of hypertension and CVD.162,163 A study of 31 Japanese males with essential
hypertension placed on an exercise program for 10 weeks showed a 26% increase in taurine levels.

The BP reduction of 14.8/6.6 mmHg was proportional to increases in serum taurine and reductions in
plasma norepinephrine.164 Fujita et al.157 demonstrated a reduction in BP of 9/4.1 mmHg ( p < .05) in 19
hypertension subjects given 6 g of taurine for 7 days.

Taurine has numerous beneficial effects on the
cardiovascular system and BP.158 The recommended dose of taurine is 2–3 g/day at which no adverse
effects are noted, but higher doses up to 6 g/day may be needed to reduce BP significantly.1,70,71,156–164
ω-3 F ats
The ω-3 fatty acids found in cold-water fish, fish oils, flax, flax seed, flax oil, and nuts lower BP in
observational, epidemiological, and prospective clinical trials.165–175 The findings are strengthened
by a dose-related response in hypertension as well as a relationship to the specific concomitant dis -
eases associated with hypertension.165–175222 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Studies indicate that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at 2 g/day reduces BP and heart rate.165–175
The average reduction in BP is 8/5 mmHg and heart rate falls to about 6 beats per minute usually in
about 6 weeks.1,70,71,165,170–178 Fish oil at 4–9 g/day or in a combination of DHA and eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) at 3–5 g/day will also reduce BP.1,170–175 However, formation of EPA and ultimately DHA
from α-lipoic acid (ALA) is decreased in the presence of high LA (the essential ω-6 fatty acid), satu -
rated fats, trans fatty acids, alcohol, several nutrient deficiencies (magnesium and vitamin B 6), and
aging, all of which inhibit the desaturase enzymes.165 Eating cold-water fish three times per week
may be as effective as high-dose fish oil in reducing BP in hypertensive patients, and the protein in
the fish may also have antihypertensive effects.1,165 In patients with chronic kidney disease, 4 g of
ω-3 fatty acids reduced BP measured with 24-hour ABM over 8 weeks by 3.3/2.9 mmHg compared
to placebo ( p < .0001).179
The ideal ratio of ω-6 fatty acids to ω-3 fatty acids is between 1:1 and 1:4 with a polyunsatu -
rated to saturated (P/S) fat ratio greater than 1.5 to 2.0 .2 ω-3 Fatty acids increase eNOS and nitric
oxide, improve endothelial function, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce calcium influx, suppress
ACE activity, and improve parasympathetic tone.1,165–173 The ω-6 fatty acid family includes LA,
GLA, dihomo- γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), and arachidonic acid (AA), which do not usually lower BP
significantly but may prevent increases in BP induced by saturated fats.180 GLA may block stress-
induced hypertension by increasing PGE1 and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), reducing aldosterone levels,
and reducing adrenal AT1R density and affinity.177
The ω-3 fatty acids have a multitude of other cardiovascular consequences that modulate BP such
as increases in eNOS and nitric oxide, improvement in ED, reduction in plasma norepinephrine
and increase in PNS tone, suppression of ACE activity, and improvement of insulin resistance.180
The recommended daily dose is 3000–5000 mg/day of combined DHA and EPA in a ratio of
3 parts EPA to 2 parts DHA and about 50% of this dose as GLA combined with γ-/δ-tocopherol at
100 mg/g of DHA and EPA to get the ω-3 index to 8% or higher to reduce BP and provide optimal
cardioprotection.181 DHA is more effective than EPA for reducing BP and should be given at 2 g/day
if administered alone.165,175
ω-9 F ats
Olive oil is rich in ω-9 monounsaturated fat (MUFA) oleic acid, which has been associated with
BP and lipid reduction in Mediterranean and other diets.182–185 Olive oil and MUFAs have shown
consistent reductions in BP in most clinical studies in humans.182–184,186–194 In one study, the SBP fell
by 8 mmHg ( p ≤ .05) and the DBP fell by 6 mmHg ( p ≤ .01) in both clinic and 24-hour ambulatory
BP monitoring in MUFA-treated subjects compared to PUFA-treated subjects.182 In addition, the
need for antihypertensive medications was reduced by 48% in the MUFA group versus 4% in the
ω-6 PUFA group ( p < .005).

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was more effective than sunflower oil in
lowering SBP in a group of 31 elderly hypertensive patients in a double-blind randomized crossover
study.191 The SBP was 136 mmHg in the EVOO-treated subjects versus 150 mmHg in the sunflower-
treated group ( p < .01).

Olive oil also reduces BP in hypertensive diabetic subjects.192 It is the high
oleic acid content in olive oil that reduces BP.184 In stage I hypertensive patients, oleuropein-olive
leaf (Olea eurpoaea ) extract 500 mg bid for 8 weeks reduced BP by 11.5/4.8 mmHg, which was
similar to captopril 25 mg bid.193 Olea europaea L. aqueous extract administered to 12 patients with
hypertension at 400 mg qid for 3 months significantly reduced BP ( p < .001).186 Olive oil intake in
the EPIC study of 20,343 subjects was inversely associated with both SBP and DBP.187 In the SUN
study of 6863 subjects, BP was inversely associated with olive oil consumption, but only in men.188
In a study of 40 hypertensive monozygotic twins, olive leaf extract demonstrated a dose–response
reduction in BP at doses of 500–1000 mg/day in 8 weeks compared to placebo.189 The low-dose
groups decreased BP by 3/1 mmHg and the high-dose groups by 11/4 mmHg .189 A double-blind, ran -
domized crossover dietary intervention study over 4 months using polyphenol-rich olive oil 30 mg/
day decreased BP in the study group by 7.91/6.65 mmHg and improved endothelial function.190 223 Nutrition and Nutraceutical Supplements for the Treatment of Hypertension
The ADMA levels, oxLDL, and HS-CRP were reduced in the olive oil group.

Plasma nitrites and
nitrates increased and hyperemic area after ischemia improved in the treated group.

Olive oil inhib -
its the AT1R receptor, exerts l-type calcium channel antagonist effects, and improves wave reflec -
tions and augmentation index.195–197
EVOO also contains lipid-soluble phytonutrients such as polyphenols.

Approximately 5 mg of
phenols are found in 10 g of EVOO.182,185 About 4 Tbsp  of EVOO is equal to 40 g of EVOO, which
is the amount required to get significant reductions in BP.

Fiber
Clinical trials with various types of fiber to reduce BP have been inconsistent.198,199 Soluble
fiber,  guar gum, guava, psyllium, and oat bran may reduce BP and reduce the need for antihy -
pertensive medications in hypertensive subjects, diabetic subjects, and hypertensive–diabetic
subjects.1,70,71,198,199 The average reduction in BP is about 7.5/5.5 mmHg on 40–50 g/day of a mixed
fiber.

There is improvement in insulin sensitivity, endothelial function, reduction in SNS activity,
and increase in renal sodium loss.1,70,71,198
vitaMin c
Vitamin C is a potent water-soluble electron donor.

At physiological levels, it is an antioxi -
dant, although at supraphysiological doses such as those achieved with intravenous vitamin C it
donates electrons to different enzymes, which results in pro-oxidative effects.

At physiological
doses, vitamin C recycles vitamin E, improves ED, and produces a diuresis.200 Dietary intake of
vitamin C and plasma ascorbate concentration in humans is inversely correlated to SBP, DBP,
and heart rate.200–214
An evaluation of published clinical trials indicates that vitamin C dosing at 250 mg twice
daily will significantly lower SBP by 5–7 mmHg, and DBP by 2–4 mmHg over 8 weeks .200–214
Vitamin C will induce a sodium water diuresis, improve arterial compliance, improve endothe -
lial function, increase nitric oxide and PGI2, decrease adrenal steroid production, improve sym -
pathovagal balance, increase RBC Na/K ATPase, increase SOD, improve aortic elasticity and
compliance, improve flow-mediated vasodilation, decrease pulse wave velocity and augmentation
index, increase cyclic GMP, activate potassium channels, reduce cytosolic calcium, and reduce

Vitamin C enhances
the efficacy of amlodipine, decreases the binding affinity of the AT1R for A-II by disrupting the
ATR1 disulfide bridges, and enhances the antihypertensive effects of medications in the elderly
with refractory hypertension.1,70,71,204–209 In elderly patients with refractory hypertension already on
maximum pharmacological therapy, 600 mg of vitamin C daily lowered the BP by 20/16 mmHg.209
The lower the initial ascorbate serum level, the better the BP response.

A serum level of 100 μmol/L
is recommended.1,70,71 The SBP and 24 ABM show the most significant reductions with chronic oral
administration of vitamin C.204–209 Block et al.210 in an elegant depletion–repletion study of vitamin
C demonstrated an inverse correlation of plasma ascorbate levels, SBP, and DBP.

In a meta-analysis
of 13 clinical trials with 284 patients, vitamin C at 500 mg/day over 6 weeks reduced SBP by
3.9 mmHg and DBP by 2.1 mmHg.211 Hypertensive subjects were found to have significantly lower
plasma ascorbate levels compared to normotensive subjects (40  vs. 57 μmol/L , respectively),215 and
plasma ascorbate is inversely correlated with BP even in healthy, normotensive individuals.210
vitaMin e
Most studies have not shown reductions in BP with most forms of tocopherols or tocotrienols.1,70,71
Patients with T2DM and controlled hypertension (130/76 mmHg) on prescription medications
with an average BP of 136/76 mmHg were administered mixed tocopherols containing 60%  γ-, 224 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
25% δ-, and 15% α-tocopherols.216 The BP actually increased by 6.8/3.6 mmHg in the study
patients ( p < .0001) but was less compared to the increase with α-tocopherol of 7/5.3 mmHg
(p < .0001).

This may be a reflection of drug interactions with tocopherols via cytochrome P 450
(3A4 and 4F2) and reduction in the serum levels of the pharmacological treatments that were simul -
taneously being given.216 γ-Tocopherol may have natriuretic effects by inhibition of the 70pS potas -
sium channel in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and lower BP.217 Both α-tocopherol
and γ-tocopherol improve insulin sensitivity and enhance adiponectin expression via PPAR γ-
dependent processes, which have the potential to lower BP and serum glucose.218 If vitamin E
has an antihypertensive effect, it is probably small and may be limited to untreated hypertensive
patients or those with known vascular disease or other concomitant problems such as diabetes or
hyperlipidemia.

vitaMin d
Vitamin D3 may have an independent and direct role in the regulation of BP and insulin metab -
olism.219–229 Vitamin D influences BP by its effects on calcium phosphate metabolism, RAAS,
immune system, control of endocrine glands, and ED.220 If the vitamin D level is below 30 ng/mL,
the circulating PRA levels are higher, which increases A-II, increases BP, and blunts plasma renal
blood flow.225 The lower the level of vitamin D, the greater the risk of hypertension, with the lowest
quartile of serum vitamin D having a 52% incidence of hypertension and the highest quartile hav -
ing a 20% incidence.225 Vitamin D3 markedly suppresses renin transcription by a VDR-mediated
mechanism via the JGA apparatus.

Its role in electrolytes, volume, and BP homeostasis indicates
that vitamin D3 is important in the amelioration of hypertension.

Vitamin D lowers ADMA, sup -
presses proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF- α, increases nitric oxide, improves endothelial
function and arterial elasticity, decreases vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy, regulates electro -
lytes and blood volume, increases insulin sensitivity, reduces free fatty acid concentration, regulates
the expression of the natriuretic peptide receptor, and lowers HS-CRP.221–225
The hypotensive effect of vitamin D was inversely related to the pretreatment serum levels of
1,25 (OH)2 D3.

Pfeifer et al.

showed that short-term  supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium
is more effective in reducing SBP than calcium alone.229 In a group of 148 women with low 25 (OH)2
D3 levels, the administration of 1200 mg  calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D3 reduced SBP 9.3%
more ( p < .02) compared to 1200 mg of calcium alone.

The HR fell by 5.4% ( p = .02), but DBP
was not changed.

The range in BP  reduction was 3.6/3.1 to 13.1/7.2 mmHg.

The reduction in BP
is related to the pretreatment level of vitamin D3, dose of vitamin D3, and serum level of vitamin
D3, but BP is reduced only in hypertensive patients.

Although vitamin D deficiency is associated
with hypertension in observational studies, randomized clinical trials and their meta-analyses have
yielded inconclusive results.227 In  addition, vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms may effect the
risk of hypertension in men.228 A 25 hydroxyvitamin D level of 60 ng/mL is recommended.

vitaMin b6 (P yridoxine )
Low serum vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) levels are associated with hypertension in humans.230 One
human study by Aybak et al.231 proved that high-dose vitamin B6 at 5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks
significantly lowered BP by 14/10 mmHg.

Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is a cofactor in neurotrans -
mitter and hormone synthesis in the CNS (norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, GABA, and
kynurenine), increases cysteine synthesis to neutralize aldehydes, enhances the production of
glutathione, blocks calcium channels, improves insulin resistance, decreases central sympathetic
tone, and reduces end organ responsiveness to glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.1,70,71,232,233
Vitamin B6 is reduced with chronic diuretic therapy and heme pyrollactams (HPU).

Vitamin B6
thus has a similar action to central α-agonists, diuretics, and CCBs.

The recommended dose is
20 mg/day orally.225 Nutrition and Nutraceutical Supplements for the Treatment of Hypertension
Flavonoids
Over 4000 naturally occurring flavonoids have been identified in such diverse substances as fruits,
vegetables, red wine, tea, soy, and licorice.234 Flavonoids (flavonols, flavones, and isoflavones) are
potent free radical scavengers that inhibit lipid peroxidation, prevent atherosclerosis, promote vas -
cular relaxation, and have antihypertensive properties.234 In addition, they reduce stroke and provide
cardioprotective effects that reduce CHD morbidity and mortality.235
Resveratrol is a potent antioxidant and antihypertensive found in the skin of red grapes and
in red wine.

Resveratrol administration to humans reduces augmentation index, improves arterial
compliance, and lowers central arterial pressure when administered as 250 mL of either regular
or dealcoholized red wine.236 There was a significant reduction in the aortic augmentation index
of 6.1% with the dealcoholized red wine and of 10.5% with regular red wine.

The central arterial
pressure was significantly reduced by dealcoholized red wine at 7.4 mmHg and by regular red wine
at 5.4 mmHg.

Resveratrol increases flow-mediated vasodilation in a dose-related manner, improves
ED, prevents uncoupling of eNOS, increases adiponectin, lowers HS-CRP, and blocks the effects of
A-II.237–240 The recommended dose is 250 mg/day of trans resveratrol.142
lycoPene
Lycopene is a fat-soluble phytonutrient in the carotenoid family.

Dietary sources include tomatoes,
guava, pink grapefruit, watermelon, apricots, and papaya in high concentrations.241–245 Lycopene
produces a significant reduction in BP, serum lipids, and oxidative stress markers.241–245 Paran
et al.245 evaluated 30 subjects with grade I hypertension, age 40–65 years, taking no antihyperten -
sive or antilipid medications and treated them with a tomato lycopene extract (10 mg lycopene) for
8 weeks .

The SBP was reduced from 144 to 135 mmHg (9 mmHg reduction, p < .01), and the DBP
fell from 91 to 84 mmHg (7 mmHg reduction, p < .01).

The SBP was reduced from 144 to 135 mmHg (9 mmHg reduction, p < .01), and the DBP
fell from 91 to 84 mmHg (7 mmHg reduction, p < .01).

Another study of 35 subjects with grade I
hypertension showed similar results on SBP but not DBP.241 Englehard gave a tomato extract to 31
hypertensive subjects over 12 weeks, demonstrating a significant BP reduction of 10/4 mmHg.242
Patients on various antihypertensive agents including ACEI, CCB, and diuretics had a significant
BP reduction of 5.4/3 mmHg over 6 weeks when administered a standardized tomato extract.243
Other studies have not shown changes in BP with lycopene.244 Lycopene and tomato extract improve
ED and reduce plasma total oxidative stress.246 The recommended daily intake of lycopene is
10–20 mg in food or in the supplement form.

Pycnogenol
Pycnogenol, a bark extract from the French maritime pine, at doses of 200 mg/day resulted in a
significant reduction in SBP from 139.9 to 132.7 mmHg ( p < .05) in 11 patients with mild hyperten -
sion over 8 weeks in a double-blind randomized placebo crossover trial.

The DBP fell from 93.8
to 92.0 mmHg.

Pycnogenol acts as a natural ACEI, protects cell membranes from oxidative stress,
increases NO and improves endothelial function, reduces serum thromboxane concentrations,
decreases myeloperoxidase activity, improves renal cortical blood flow, reduces urinary albumin
excretion, and decreases HS-CRP.247–251 Other studies have shown reductions in BP and a decreased
need for ACEI and CCB and reductions in endothelin-1, HgA1C, fasting glucose, LDL-C, and
myeloperoxidase.248,249,251
garlic
Clinical trials utilizing the correct dose, type of garlic, and well-absorbed long-acting prepara -
tions have shown consistent reductions in BP in hypertensive patients with an average reduction in
BP of 8.4/7.3 mmHg.252–253 Not all garlic preparations are processed similarly and are comparable 226 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
in antihypertensive potency.1 In addition, cultivated garlic ( Allium sativum ), wild uncultivated
garlic or bear garlic ( Allium urisinum ), as well as the effects of aged, fresh, and long-acting gar -
lic  preparations differ.1,70,71,253 Garlic is also effective in reducing BP in patients with uncontrolled
hypertension already on antihypertensive medication.254 A garlic homogenate-based  supplement
was administered to 34 prehypertensive and stage I hypertensive patients at 300 mg/day over
12 weeks with a reduction in BP of 6.6–7.5/4.6–5.2 mmHg.

Aged garlic at doses of 240–960 mg/
day given to 79 hypertensive subjects over 12 weeks significantly lowered SBP 11.8 ± 5.4mmHg in
the high-dose garlic group.

A longer acting garlic  may reduce BP better than a shorter acting garlic.

A Cochrane Database review indicated a net reduction in BP of 10–12/6–9 mmHg in all  clinical
trials with garlic.

A longer acting garlic  may reduce BP better than a shorter acting garlic.

A Cochrane Database review indicated a net reduction in BP of 10–12/6–9 mmHg in all  clinical
trials with garlic.

In a double-blind, parallel, and randomized placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients,
900 mg of aged garlic extract with 2.4 mg of S-allylcysteine was administered daily for 12 weeks
and reduced SBP, 10.2 mmHg ( p = .03), more than the control group.254
Approximately 10,000 mcg of allicin (one of the active ingredients in garlic) per day, the
amount contained in four cloves of garlic (5 g), is required to achieve a significant BP-lowering
effect.1,70,71,253,254 Garlic has ACEI activity and calcium channel-blocking activity; reduces catechol -
amine sensitivity; improves arterial compliance; increases bradykinin and nitric oxide; and contains
adenosine, magnesium, flavonoids, sulfur, allicin, phosphorous, and ajoenes that reduce BP.1,70,71
seaweed
Wakame seaweed ( Undaria pinnatifida ) is the most popular, edible seaweed in Japan.255 In humans,
3.3 g of dried wakame for 4 weeks significantly reduced both SBP, 14 ± 3 mmHg, and DBP,
5 ± 2 mmHg ( p < .01).256 In a study of 62 middle-aged, male subjects with mild hypertension given
a potassium-loaded, ion-exchanging, sodium-adsorbing, and potassium-releasing seaweed prepara -
tion, significant BP reductions occurred at 4 weeks on 12 and 24 g/day of the seaweed preparation
(p < .01).257 The MAP fell by 11.2 mmHg ( p < .001) in the sodium-sensitive subjects and 5.7 mmHg
(p < .05) in the sodium-insensitive subjects, which correlated with PRA.

Seaweed and sea vegetables contain almost all of the seawater’s 771 minerals and rare earth
elements, fiber, and alginate in a colloidal form.255–257 The primary effect of wakame appears to be
through its ACEI activity from at least four parent tetrapeptides and possibly their dipeptide and
tripeptide metabolites, especially those containing the amino acid sequence Val-Tyr, Ile-Tyr, Phe-

Other varieties of seaweed may reduce BP by reducing intestinal sodium absorption and increasing
intestinal potassium absorption.257
sesaMe
Sesame has been shown to reduce BP in several small randomized, placebo-controlled human
studies over 30–60 days.260–268 Sesame lowers BP either alone261–265 or in combination with nife -
dipine,260,264 diuretics, and β-blockers.261,265 In a group of 13 mild hypertensive subjects, 60 mg of
sesamin for 4 weeks lowered SBP, 3.5 mmHg ( p < .044), and DBP, 1.9 mmHg ( p < .045).262 Black
sesame meal at 2.52 g/day over 4 weeks in 15 subjects reduced SBP by 8.3 mmHg ( p < .05), but
there was a nonsignificant reduction in DBP of 4.2 mmHg.263 Sesame oil at 35 g/day significantly
lowered central BP within 1 hour and also maintained BP reduction chronically in 30 hypertensive
subjects, reduced heart rate, reduced arterial stiffness, decreased augmentation index and pulse
wave velocity, decreased HS-CRP, improved NO, decreased endothelin-I, and improved antioxi -
dant capacity.268 In addition, sesame lowers serum glucose, HgbAIC, and LDL-C; increases HDL;
reduces oxidative stress markers; and increases glutathione, SOD, GPx, CAT, vitamin C, vitamin
E, and vitamin A.260,261,263–265 The active ingredients are natural ACEIs such as sesamin, sesamolin,
sesaminol glucosides, and furofuran  lignans, which are also suppressors of NFkB.266,267  All of these
effects lower inflammation and oxidative stress, improve oxidative defense, and reduce BP.266,267227 Nutrition and Nutraceutical Supplements for the Treatment of Hypertension
beverages : tea, coFFee, and cocoa
Green tea , black tea, and extracts of active components in both have demonstrated reduction in
BP in humans.269–275 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 379 hypertensive subjects given
green tea extract 370 mg/day for 3 months, BP was reduced significantly at 4/4 mmHg with simul -
taneous decreases in HS-CRP, TNF- α, glucose, and insulin levels.272
Dark chocolate  (100 g) and cocoa  with a high content of polyphenols (30 mg or more) have
been shown to significantly reduce BP in humans.276–287 A meta-analysis of 173 hypertensive sub -
jects given cocoa for a mean duration of 2 weeks had a significant reduction in BP, 4.7/2.8 mmHg
(p = .002 for SBP, and p = .006 for DBP).276 Fifteen subjects given 100 g of dark chocolate with
500 mg of polyphenols for 15 days had a 6.4-mmHg reduction in SBP ( p < .05) with a nonsig -
nificant change in DBP.277 Cocoa at 30 mg of polyphenols reduced BP in prehypertensive and
stage I   hypertensive patients by 2.9/1.9 mmHg at 18 weeks ( p < .001).278 Two more recent meta-
analyses of 13 trials and 10 trials with 297 patients found a significant reduction in BP of 3.2/2.0 and
4.5/3.2 mmHg, respectively.280,283 The BP reduction is the greatest in those with the highest baseline
BP and those with at least 50%–70% cocoa at doses of 6–100 g/day.280,282 Cocoa may also improve
insulin resistance and endothelial function.277,284,285
Polyphenols, chlorogenic acids (CGAs), the ferulic acid metabolite of CGAs, and dihydrocaffeic
acids decrease BP in a dose-dependent manner, increase eNOS, and improve endothelial function
in humans.288–290 CGAs in green coffee bean extract at doses of 140 mg/day significantly reduced
SBP and DBP in 28 subjects in a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial.

A study of 122 male
subjects demonstrated a dose–response in SBP and DBP with doses of CGA from 46 to 185 mg/
day.

The group that received the 185-mg dose had a significant reduction in BP of 5.6/3.9 mmHg ( p
< .01) over 28 days.

The group that received the 185-mg dose had a significant reduction in BP of 5.6/3.9 mmHg ( p
< .01) over 28 days.

Hydroxyhydroquinone is another component of coffee beans that reduces the
efficacy of CGAs in a dose-dependent manner, which partially explains the conflicting results of
coffee ingestion on BP.288,290 Furthermore, there is genetic variation in the enzyme responsible for
the metabolism of caffeine that modifies the association between coffee intake , amount of coffee
ingested and the risk of hypertension, heart rate, MI, arterial stiffness, arterial wave reflections,
and urinary catecholamine levels.291 Fifty-nine percent of the population has the IF/IA allele of the
CYP1A2 genotype, which confers slow metabolism of caffeine.

Heavy coffee drinkers who are slow
metabolizers had a 3.00 hazard ratio for developing hypertension.

In contrast, fast metabolizers with
the IA/IA allele have a 0.36 hazard ratio for incident hypertension.291
additional  coMPounds
Melatonin  demonstrates significant antihypertensive effects in humans in numerous double-blind,
randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trials at 3–5 mg/day.292–302 The average reduction in BP
is 6/3 mmHg.

Melatonin stimulates GABA receptors in the CNS and vascular melatonin receptors,
inhibits plasma A-II levels, improves endothelial function, increases NO, vasodilates, improves noc -
turnal dipping, lowers cortisol, and is additive with ARBs.

β-Blockers reduce melatonin secretion.303
Hesperidin  significantly lowered DBP 3 to 4 mmHg ( p < .02) and improved microvascular endo -
thelial reactivity in 24 obese hypertensive male subjects in a randomized, controlled crossover study
over 4 weeks for each of three treatment groups consuming 500 mL of orange juice, hesperidin, or
placebo.304
Pomegranate  juice is rich in tannins and has numerous other properties that improve vascular
health and reduces SBP by 5%–12%.305,306 A study of 51 healthy subjects given 330 mg/day of
pomegranate juice showed reduction in BP of 3.14/2.33 mmHg ( p < .001).306 Pomegranate juice
also suppresses the postprandial increase in SBP following a high-fat meal.306 Pomegranate juice
reduces serum ACE activity by 36% and has antiatherogenic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory
effects.305,306 Pomegranate juice at 50 mL/day reduced carotid IMT by 30% over 1 year; increased
PON by 83%; decreased oxLDL by 59%–90%; decreased antibodies to oxLDL by 19%; increased 228 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
total antioxidant status by 130%; reduced TGF- β; increased catalase, SOD, and GPx; increased
eNOS and NO; and improved endothelial function.305–306 Pomegranate juice works like an ACEI.

Grape seed extract  (GSE) was administered to subjects in a meta-analysis of randomized trials
and demonstrated a significant reduction in SBP of 1.54 mmHg ( p < .02).307,308 A significant reduc -
tion in BP of 11/8 mmHg ( p < .05) was seen in another dose–response study with 150–300 mg/day
of GSE over 4 weeks.309 GSE has a high phenolic content, which activates the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway that phosphorylates eNOS and increases NO.309,310
coenzy Me q10 (ubiquinone )
Coenzyme Q10 has consistent and significant antihypertensive effects in patients with essential
hypertension.1,311–320 The literature is summarized as follows:
• Compared to normotensive patients, essential hypertensive patients have a higher inci -
dence (sixfold) of coenzyme Q10 deficiency documented by serum levels.1
• Doses of 120–225 mg/day of coenzyme Q10, depending on the delivery method or the
concomitant ingestion with a fatty meal, are necessary to achieve a therapeutic level of
3 μg/mL .1,316,317 This dose is usually 3–5 mg/kg/day of coenzyme Q10.

Oral dosing levels
may become lower with nanoparticle and emulsion delivery systems intended to facilitate
absorption.318 Adverse effects have not been characterized in the literature.

Oral dosing levels
may become lower with nanoparticle and emulsion delivery systems intended to facilitate
absorption.318 Adverse effects have not been characterized in the literature.

• Patients with the lowest coenzyme Q10 serum levels may have the best antihypertensive
response to supplementation.

• The average reduction in BP is about 15/10 mmHg and heart rate falls to 5 beats per minute
based on reported studies and meta-analysis.

• The antihypertensive effect takes time to reach its peak level at 4 weeks.

Then the BP
remains stable during long-term treatment.

The antihypertensive effect is gone within
2 weeks after discontinuation of coenzyme Q10.

The reductions in BP and SVR are cor -
related with the pretreatment and posttreatment serum levels of CoQ10.

About 50% of
patients respond to oral CoQ10 supplementation for BP.312
• Approximately 50% of patients on antihypertensive drugs may be able to stop between one
and three agents.

Both total dose and frequency of administration may be reduced.

• Patients administered CoQ10 with enalapril improved the 24-hour ABM better than enala -
pril monotherapy and also normalized endothelial function.313
• CoQ10 is a lipid-phase antioxidant and free radical scavenger, increases eNOS and
NO, reduces inflammation and NF κB, and improves endothelial function and vascular
elasticity.1,314,315
Other favorable effects on cardiovascular risk factors include improvement in the serum lipid
profile and carbohydrate metabolism with reduced glucose and improved insulin sensitivity, reduced
oxidative stress, reduced heart rate, improved myocardial left ventricular function and oxygen deliv -
ery, and decreased catecholamine levels.1,314,315
α-liPoic acid
ALA is known as thioctic acid in Europe, where it is a prescription medication.

It is a sulfur-
containing compound with antioxidant activity in both water and lipid phases.1,70,71 Its use is well
established in the treatment of certain forms of liver disease and in the delay of onset of periph -
eral neuropathy in patients with diabetes.

Recent research has evaluated its potential role in the
treatment of hypertension, especially as part of the MS.321–324 In a double-blind crossover study of
36 patients over 8 weeks with CHD and hypertension, 200 mg of lipoic acid with 500 mg of acetyl-
l-carnitine significantly reduced BP by 7/3 mmHg and increased brachial artery diameter.321 The 229 Nutrition and Nutraceutical Supplements for the Treatment of Hypertension
QUALITY study of 40 patients with DM and stage I hypertension showed significant improvements
in BP, urinary albumin excretion, FMD, and insulin sensitivity over 8 weeks with a combination of
quinapril (40 mg/day) and lipoic acid (600 mg/day), which was greater than either alone.323 Lipoic
acid increases levels of glutathione, cysteine, vitamin C, and vitamin E; inhibits NF κB; reduces
endothelin -1, tissue factor, and VCAM-1; increases cAMP; downregulates CD4 immune expression
on mononuclear cells; reduces oxidative stress and inflammation; reduces atherosclerosis in animal
models; decreases serum aldehydes; and closes calcium channels, which improves vasodilation,
increases NO and nitrosothiols, improves endothelial function, and lowers BP.1,321–324 Lipoic acid
normalizes membrane calcium channels by providing sulfhydryl groups, decreasing cytosolic free
calcium, and lowering SVR.

In addition, lipoic acid improves insulin sensitivity, lowering glucose
and advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), which improves BP control and lowers serum tri -
glycerides.

Morcos et al.324 showed stabilization of urinary albumin excretion in DM subjects given
600 mg of ALA compared to placebo for 18 months ( p < .05).

The recommended dose is 100–200 mg/day of R-lipoic acid with biotin 2–4 mg/day to prevent
biotin depletion with long-term use of lipoic acid.

N-acetyl cysteine
NAC and l-arginine (ARG) in combination reduce endothelial activation and BP in hypertensive
patients with T2DM.325 Over 6 months, 24 subjects given placebo or NAC with ARG significantly
reduced both SBP and DBP ( p = .05).325 In addition, oxLDL, HS-CRP, ICAM, VCAM, fibrinogen,
and PAI-1 were decreased, whereas HDL, NO, and endothelial postischemic vasodilation were
increased.325 NAC increases NO via IL-1B and increases iNOS mRNA, increases glutathione by
increasing cysteine levels, reduces the affinity for the AT1 receptor by disrupting disulfide groups,
blocks the l-type calcium channel, lowers homocysteine, and improves IMT.325–328 The recom -

significant reductions in DBP of 2.6 mmHg ( p = .035).332 Thirty-six mildly hypertensive patients
were administered 500 mg of hawthorn extract for 10 weeks, and they showed a nonsignificant trend
in DBP reduction ( p = .081) compared to placebo.333 Hawthorn acts like an ACEI, a beta blocker
(BB), a CCB, and a diuretic.

More studies are needed to determine the efficacy, long-term effects,
and dose of hawthorn for the treatment of hypertension.

quercetin
Quercetin is an antioxidant flavonol found in apples, berries, and onions that reduces BP in hyper -
tensive individuals.334–336 But the hypotensive effects do not appear to be mediated by changes in
HS-CRP, TNF- α, ACE activity, ET-1, NO, vascular reactivity, or FMD.334 Quercetin is metabo -
lized by CYP 3A4.

Quercetin was administered to 12 hypertensive men at an oral dose of 1095
mg, with reduction in mean BP by 5 mmHg, SBP by 7 mmHg, and DBP by 3 mmHg.304 The
maximal plasma level at 10 hours was 2.3 ± 1.8 μmol/L, with return to baseline levels at 17 hours.

230 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Forty-one prehypertensive and stage I hypertensive subjects were enrolled in a randomized, double-
blind, and placebo-controlled crossover study with 730 mg of quercetin per day versus placebo.335
In the stage I hypertensive patients, the BP was reduced by 7/5 mmHg ( p < .05), but there were no
changes in  oxidative stress markers.335 Quercetin administered to 93 overweight or obese subjects
at 150 mg/day (plasma levels of 269 nmol/L) over 6 weeks lowered SBP to 2.9 mmHg in the hyper -
tensive group and up to 3.7 mmHg in SBP in the patients 25–50 years of age.336 The recommended
dose of quercetin is 500 mg bid.

CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS
coMbining  Food and nutrients  witH Medications
Several of the strategic combinations of nutraceutical supplements together or with antihypertensive
drugs have been shown to lower BP more than medications alone:
• Sesame with β-blockers, diuretics, and nifedipine
• Pycnogenol with ACEI and CCB
• Lycopene with ACEI, CCB, and diuretics
• ALA with ACEI or acetyl- l-carnitine
• Vitamin C with CCBs
• N-acetyl cysteine with arginine
• Garlic with ACEI, diuretics, and β-blockers
• Coenzyme Q10 with ACEI and CCB
• Taurine with magnesium
• Potassium with all antihypertensive agents
• Magnesium with all antihypertensive agents
Many antihypertensive drugs may cause nutrient depletions that can actually interfere with their
antihypertensive action or cause other metabolic adverse effects manifest through the laboratory
or with clinical symptoms.337–339 Diuretics decrease potassium, magnesium, phosphorous, sodium,
chloride, folate, vitamin B6, zinc, iodine, and coenzyme Q10; increase homocysteine, calcium, and
creatinine; and elevate serum glucose by inducing insulin resistance.

β-Blockers reduce coenzyme
Q10.

ACEIs and ARBs reduce zinc.

SUMMARY
• Vascular biology such as ED and VSMD plays a primary role in the initiation and perpetu -
ation of hypertension, CVD, and TOD.

• Nutrient–gene interactions and epigenetics are a predominant factor in promoting benefi -
cial or detrimental effects in cardiovascular health and hypertension.

• Food and nutrients can prevent, control, and treat hypertension through numerous vascular
biology mechanisms.

• Oxidative stress, inflammation, and autoimmune dysfunction initiate and propagate hyper -
tension and CVD.

• There is a role for the selected use of single and component nutraceutical supplements vita -
mins, antioxidants, and minerals in the treatment of hypertension based on scientifically
controlled studies as a complement to optimal nutritional, dietary intake from food and
other lifestyle modifications.339
• A clinical approach that incorporates diet, foods, nutrients, exercise, weight reduction,
smoking cessation, alcohol and caffeine restriction, and other lifestyle strategies can be
systematically and successfully incorporated into clinical practice (Table 9.3).231 Nutrition and Nutraceutical Supplements for the Treatment of Hypertension

10The Role of Dentistry in
Cardiovascular Health and
General Well-Being
Mark A. Breiner
If a person has cardiovascular disease, will a change in diet and supplements be sufficient to bring
down inflammation?

If the inflammatory markers are normal, is inflammation gone?

What role
does dentistry play in cardiovascular health and in health in general?

Is there a level beyond inflam -
mation that needs to be addressed?

I believe that cardiovascular problems and other health problems exist on two levels.

The first of
these is the physical level; this is the level of poor nutrition, mineral and vitamin deficiencies, and
environmental toxins.

This is also the level at which dentistry has a large impact.

Impacted wisdom
teeth, bite problems, mercury fillings, root canals, cavitations, and periodontal disease can have a
major negative impact on a patient’s health.

At this level, the problems are addressed physically;
supplements can be given, diets can be changed, and toxins can be eliminated.

Dentally, for exam -
ple, mercury fillings may be removed, bite problems can be corrected, and, sometimes, root-canaled
teeth may be extracted.

Medically, a bad heart valve may need to be replaced or a pacemaker needs
to be placed.

The second level on which health problems exist involves a patient’s core or “vital force.”
Addressing deep energetic imbalances can have a profound effect on a patient’s emotions and health.

Some of these imbalances have been passed down generationally.

Other imbalances can be more
recent, as, for example, from an accident or another traumatic experience, which leave an energetic
imprint in the cellular matrix.

Other imbalances can be more
recent, as, for example, from an accident or another traumatic experience, which leave an energetic
imprint in the cellular matrix.

These signals that disrupt normal function cause disharmony in the
symphony of “cellular song.” When these aberrant notes are removed, the melody of life will be CONTENTS

harmonious and a high level of health will result.

I believe this level plays a role in “susceptibility.”
For example, why would a 50-year-old who eats right, exercises, has low levels of toxins, has ideal
blood work, and is seemingly  healthy, suddenly drop dead of a heart attack?

I have observed that
when both the outer physical level and the inner energetic level have been addressed, patients have
attained a level of health that had eluded them for years.

As you read through this chapter, it is important to remember that these two levels—the “physi -
cal” level and the “energetic” level—are intertwined.

PHYSICAL LEVEL
The topics of nutrition, diet, and supplementation are covered elsewhere in this book.

I will focus on
the major dental issues that affect the patient’s cardiovascular and general health.

An obvious, but often overlooked, biological fact is that the blood that nourishes our lips, gums,
tongue, teeth, and oral cavity is the same blood that courses throughout our body.

Unfortunately,
there is a serious lack of training about the systemic effects that dental procedures can have on over -
all body functioning.

Dentists have been taught to make treatment decisions without recognizing
the full impact of those decisions and with little appreciation for the relationship between the mouth
and the rest of the body.

The truth is that every dental procedure is an invasion of the human system,
and that invasion may generate an adverse response elsewhere in the body.

The truth is that every dental procedure is an invasion of the human system,
and that invasion may generate an adverse response elsewhere in the body.

As you read this chapter, you will discover that one cannot treat the mouth without having an
impact on the entire body.

You will also learn that health, or lack of health, will impact the oral
cavity.

Essentially, optimum health for the mouth necessitates optimum systemic health.

Therefore,
as a dentist striving to help a patient achieve maximum oral health, I have found it essential to treat
the patient globally.

With this philosophy in mind, I coined the term “Whole-Body Dentistry®.”
When writing an article, I find it necessary to compartmentalize and categorize topics.

However,
this is not the way things work in real life.

For example, I can discuss magnesium and its vari -
ous functions and the problems associated with this deficiency.

However, magnesium does not do
its work in a vacuum; it is part of a greater whole.

It is important to keep this concept in mind.

Similarly, the mouth cannot be evaluated without considering what is occurring in the rest of the
body and vice versa.

In general, a person’s overall resistance is intimately tied to his or her genetic background, stress
levels, toxins, pH, diet, and nutrition.

Recent studies support this point of view, as they have demon -
strated a correlation between periodontal disease and an increased incidence of heart disease.

The
resulting recommendation is that periodontal disease be treated to help prevent heart problems.

It
is now thought that the underlying factor in both periodontal disease and heart disease is inflam -
mation.

I will address inflammation, especially as it relates to dentistry and heart disease; however,
that is not sufficient, it is also critical to address that which precedes inflammation to achieve opti -
mal health.

Inflammation is a complex biological response of vascular tissues to irritants like oxidants, and
bacterial and fungal infections.

Food allergies and sensitivities, psychological or emotional stress,
low-grade infection, dehydration, lack of sleep, environmental toxins, and a poor diet (too many
trans fats or sugars) can also cause inflammation.

Inflammation is, on the other hand, necessary,
or wounds and infections would never heal.

Acute inflammation is essential for life; however, as
pointed out in other areas of this book , chronic inflammation is not good.

Inflammation is the
body’s attempt at self-protection.

It is the body’s biological response to harmful or irritating sub -
stances.

Inflammation does not mean infection; rather it is the response to the infection.

Chronic
inflammation, something that lasts for several months or longer, results from a chronic low-grade
irritant, or an autoimmune response to a self-antigen.

Toxicity of the inner environment of the mouth is of great concern particularly because of the
inflammation process that can be triggered by dental toxins.

Metals in the mouth (mercury, nickel,
tin, beryllium, etc.

), toxins from root-canaled teeth, cavitations, and periodontal disease can cause 249 The Role of Dentistry in Cardiovascular Health and General Well-Being
chronic inflammation.

Given that each of these can promote inflammation, and that inflammation is
the underlying cause of heart disease, taking proper care of the mouth is very important in prevent -
ing and treating heart disease.

PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND THE INFLAMMATORY PROCESS
Periodontal disease is the most common infectious disease in the world.

Periodontal disease involves
multiple issues ranging from gingivitis, which is a simple inflammation of the gums, to periodonti -
tis, which involves the loss of bone around the teeth as a result of chronic inflammation.

Gingivitis, the early stage of gum disease, involves only the gum tissue.

The gums are often red
and swollen and tend to bleed easily.

Gingivitis, the early stage of gum disease, involves only the gum tissue.

The gums are often red
and swollen and tend to bleed easily.

In a healthy situation, there is a slight trough or sulcus between
the tooth and the gum tissue.

If gingivitis is present, the sulcus may deepen and form shallow pock -
ets of 1–3 mm.

This stage of periodontal diseases is easily reversible.

Debridement of the pocket by
the hygienist or dentist, good nutrition, supplementation with co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and vitamin
C, brushing, flossing, and often irrigation with an antimicrobial solution will ameliorate the prob -
lem.

Hormonal changes (as in pregnancy) can also cause gingivitis.

When the inflammatory problem has progressed into the bone, it is called periodontitis.

Pockets
accompanied by bone loss are now present.

Initially, these pockets will be 3–5 mm deep, but, if the
process is not halted, they will become much deeper, reaching 5–10 mm or more.

Keeping these
pockets clean becomes more and more difficult and, as a result, patients’ teeth may loosen.

If this
condition is left unchecked, and if enough bone is lost around the teeth, the teeth may need to be
removed.

Patients are often unaware that they have periodontal disease.

Therefore, to detect a problem at
the earliest stage, it is very important to maintain regular dental visits.

As part of an initial exami -
nation, I do a periodontal probing around every tooth.

If I find a pocket of more than 3 mm deep,
I suspect that bone has been lost; however, this is just historical information.

How do I know if
the pocket is actively infected and if the infectious process is ongoing?

Bleeding on probing is one
indication that this may be occurring.

However, I find that the best way to make this determina -
tion is by viewing a plaque sample.

Plaque is the sticky substance that you feel on your teeth at the
end of the day.

A sample can be gathered or taken from under the gum as well as from a pocket.

This sample is then placed on a glass slide in a solution similar to saliva, and a coverslip is placed
over it.

Using a phase-contrast microscope, I can view the sample at a magnification of 400 ×.

A
healthy slide will have certain types of bacteria, but not a lot of “activity,” whereas an unhealthy
slide will be characterized by a lot of activity, lots of white blood cells, spirochetes, and, usually,
amoebas.

An amoeba is a parasite, and a spirochete is a snake-like bacteria.

The spirochete associ -
ated with periodontal disease is called Treponema  denticola .

The specific amoeba associated with
periodontal disease is called Entamoeba  gingivalis .

T. denticola  and E. gingivalis  are not seen
in a healthy mouth.

An unhealthy slide sample taken from a pocket would indicate an ongoing
infection in that pocket.

A healthy slide sample taken from a pocket would indicate that there had
previously been a problem, but that it was presently quiescent.

No pockets, but a microladen slide,
tells me that a person may be at risk, at some point in the future, for periodontal disease and pos -
sibly other problems.

As you can see, the use of a phase-contrast microscope in the dental office
is very important.

The Heart Foundation reports that heart disease is the number one cause of death for both men
and women in the United States, with more people dying of heart disease than of AIDS and all can -
cers combined.1 With this alarming, but not surprising, statistic, it certainly is not in the best interest
of a heart patient to have a high bacterial level in their plaque.

Also on the rise for the baby-boomer generation are replacements of various joints, e.g., hips,
knees, and shoulders.

It is important for the dentist to know if these patients (as well as heart
patients) have a “poor” slide, before their hygiene visit, so steps can be taken to prevent a bacte -
remia.

It is important for the dentist to know if these patients (as well as heart
patients) have a “poor” slide, before their hygiene visit, so steps can be taken to prevent a bacte -
remia.

Subgingival irrigation with an antimicrobial agent both before and after a dental hygiene 250 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
visit, for these patients, or even for a “healthy” patient with a bad slide will help prevent a problem.

Bacteria are a major cause of inflammation, and as we are finding out, inflammation is an underly -
ing cause of many diseases, not only periodontal disease.

TREATMENT OF PERIODONTITIS
The traditional method of treating periodontitis is debridement of the pocket and, often, surgery to
decrease the depth of the pocket by moving the gums closer to where the bone currently is.

The goal
is to have a shallow pocket that can be easily cleaned by the patient.

Some dentists send a sample
from the pocket to a lab to be cultured.

The lab identifies the specific bacteria present so that an
appropriate antibiotic can be administered.

There are small antibiotic-laden chips that can be placed
in a pocket.

These chips slowly release minute amounts of antibiotic, until, eventually, the chip
resorbs.

Recently, lasers have been used in place of scalpel surgery.

The laser can sterilize the
pocket and encourage the regeneration of bone.

As opposed to surgery to move the tissue to where
the bone is, laser treatment allows the bone to regrow to meet the tissue.

In addition to having more
tooth-stabilizing bone, the result of laser treatment is a more aesthetically pleasing appearance.

In treating periodontal disease, I find that it is important to take a whole-body approach; ulti -
mately, this approach leads to improved host resistance.

Assessment of a patient’s nutritional status
is beneficial.

Important information can be obtained by blood and/or hair analysis.

Supplementation
with natural vitamin C, CoQ10, magnesium, calcium, homeopathic tissue salts, and immune
enhancers such as thymus and the herb cat’s claw can be advantageous.

Bleeding gums and loose
teeth, which are common indications of periodontal disease, are also among the symptoms of mer -
cury toxicity; thus, removal of mercury (silver) fillings is beneficial.

Addressing not just the “physi -
cal” level, but also the “energetic” level of imbalances is also important.

In short, anything that can
be done to enhance the immune system is valuable.

PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND YOUR HEART
Interestingly, research on the relationship of periodontal disease to heart disease goes back over
150 years.

The book, Death  and Dentistry , by Dr. Martin Fisher, published in 1940, chronicles the
role of mouth bacteria in many diseases.2 The impact of germs in the mouth on systemic disease
was also shown in other research conducted many years ago; however, because that research is not
“modern” research, it tends to be ignored.

But the truth does not vary with time.

In fact, the con -
nection was even clearer before the introduction of antibiotics and the overwhelming number of
pharmaceuticals used today.

Numerous studies have shown that those with periodontal disease have a higher incidence of heart
disease.

The same bacteria, which are specific to the mouth, have been isolated from heart tissue
and arterial plaque.3,4 Studies also show increased risk of stroke for those with periodontal disease.5,6
Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are a marker for increased stroke and heart attack risk.

CRP is a key marker of inflammation and is produced in response to infection and injury.

CRP also
causes clotting, which can lead to heart attack, stroke, and pulmonary emboli.

CRP is a key marker of inflammation and is produced in response to infection and injury.

CRP also
causes clotting, which can lead to heart attack, stroke, and pulmonary emboli.

Many people with
periodontal disease have elevated levels of CRP.7 One study showed that prescribing 20 mg of the
antibiotic doxycycline twice a day (normally 1000 mg/day is given) to patients with periodontal dis -
ease lowered CRP by 50%.8 Doxycycline is specific for spirochetes.

I have often observed that CRP
decreases when a whole body approach is taken to reduce periodontal inflammation and/or infection.

Joyce, a 43-year-old woman, came to see me as a new patient.

In discussing her medical history,
she related that she had a high CRP level and that her physician had run extensive tests to uncover
the source.

All tests were negative.

I viewed a sample of her plaque under a phase-contrast micro -
scope and saw a multitude of spirochetes and amoebae.

After Joyce’s periodontal infection was
treated and cleared, her slide normalized and her CRP dropped to a normal level; it has remained
normal for the past 9 years .251 The Role of Dentistry in Cardiovascular Health and General Well-Being
METALS IN THE MOUTH
When amalgam fillings, which are an alloy of mercury and other metals, were first introduced into
the United States in 1833, many dentists were outraged at the suggestion of placing such a highly
toxic metal in their patients’ mouths.

The amalgam filling is an alloy of mercury with copper,
tin, zinc, and silver.

Because mercury is the main component of an amalgam, representing about
50% of the alloy, it is more accurate to call these fillings “mercury fillings”; however, for market -
ing purposes, they came to be called, “silver fillings.” The controversy over the use of mercury in
dental fillings continues to this very day, with the proponents saying there is no scientific evidence
that mercury from fillings causes any harm.

Today, everyone agrees that mercury does come out of
the amalgam fillings.

It comes off as a vapor (its most toxic form), which is easily absorbed.

All the
components of an amalgam filling are potentially toxic; however, mercury is by far the most toxic.

Its effects are well documented.

Mercury is mercury no matter where it comes from.

Mercury causes
psychological, neurological, immunological, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and oral disturbances.

MERCURY AND CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS
Because mercury is so toxic, it will cause problems in any tissue or organ in which it resides, includ -
ing the heart and the arteries.

Studies have shown an affinity for accumulation in the cardiovascular
system.

In a 1983 study, animals were exposed to radioactively labeled mercury vapor by inhala -
tion.

A significant uptake of mercury was found in various organs, including the heart muscle.9
Studies done on rats, mice, and monkeys have shown that exposure to inhaled mercury vapor results
in a larger accumulation of mercury in the heart than does exposure to inorganic mercury.10 In a
study of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) patients, the mean mercury concentration was
22,000 times higher than that in control subjects.11 In one study where animals were exposed to
grinding of amalgam fillings, it was shown that mercury vapor from dental amalgam rapidly, and
dramatically, accumulated in the heart tissue.12 In another study radioactively labeled amalgam
fillings were placed in the teeth of pregnant sheep.

Within days after placement of the amalgam
fillings, the radioactively labeled mercury was found in the heart tissue of the mother sheep and
unborn fetuses.13 A human study comparing subjects with and without amalgam fillings, showed
that amalgam-bearing subjects had significantly higher blood pressure, lower heart rates, and lower
hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

The subjects with the amalgam fillings had a greater incidence
of chest pains, tachycardia, anemia, and fatigue.14 Mercury also targets the pituitary, thyroid, and
adrenal glands as well as the brain; all of these influence heart function.15
Numerous studies show that mercury damages the heart and blood vessels.

Mercury has an
effect on blood pressure and interferes with the electrical conduction pattern of the heart.

It dam -
ages heart muscle tissue, blood vessels, and heart valves.

I have had some patients with a reversal
of their mitral valve prolapse after having mercury removed from their mouth and having mercury
detoxed from their body.

In addition, numerous cases of tachycardia and blood pressure problems
have resolved with mercury removal.

Mercury also causes blood to clot faster and easier.16
As previously mentioned, mercury causes oxidative stress and, therefore, inflammation.

In fact,
all the components of amalgam fillings cause oxidative stress.

Not only for heart health but also for
health in general, it is not a good idea to have mercury implanted in the mouth.

REMOVAL OF MERCURY “SILVER” FILLINGS
Because any stimulation of the fillings, such as with a dental drill, increases the amount of mercury
vapor released, removal of mercury fillings should be done in a manner that protects the patient,
the dentist, and the assistant.

Patient safety precautions during amalgam removal include having the
patient breathe oxygen, using large amounts of water and high-speed suction, use of a rubber dam
to isolate teeth from the rest of the mouth, and coating the patient’s mouth with a powder that has a
strong affinity for mercury.252 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
An equally important aspect of protecting the patient relates to preparation prior to mercury
removal.

It is essential to ascertain that the patient’s organs of detoxification are functioning prop -
erly.

In this regard, it is critical that the mesenchyme, which is the tissue that surrounds every cell
of the body, be functioning optimally.

Too often I see patients who have had their mercury fillings
removed without proper preparation become extremely ill.

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to
go into depth as to what is needed to determine if the patient is at a point where they can have their
mercury fillings removed.

Suffice it to say that removal of mercury fillings is not to be taken lightly,
and a patient should seek out a dentist trained in how to do this safely.

Some facts about mercury are as follows:
1.

Amalgam fillings are approximately 40%–50% mercury.

2.

Mercury continuously comes out of the fillings in the lethal vapor form.

3.

Any stimulation to the fillings, e.g., chewing, grinding, and drinking hot liquids, increases
the amount of vapor coming from the fillings.

4.

Mercury from the fillings enters the body and builds up over time.

5.

Mercury passes the placental barrier and accumulates in the fetus.

6.

Mercury passes from the mother’s milk to the infant.

7.

There is no safe level of mercury in the human body.

ROOT CANALS AND THE INFLAMMATORY PROCESS
When a tooth dies as evidenced by pain, abscess, or radiographic evidence, a patient is confronted
with a choice of extraction of the offending tooth or saving the tooth by having a root canal.

Dentists
are taught that it is usually best to keep a tooth in place by performing a root canal.

If the tooth is at a
point where it is beyond saving, dentists will usually recommend an extraction followed by an implant.

Unfortunately, dentists are not taught about the possible systemic effects of either the root canal or the
implant.

However, the possible negative systemic effects are real and can have a  devastating effect on
the health of the patient.

It is not just cardiovascular disease that has been related to the  bacteria and tox -
ins from root canals.

It is not just cardiovascular disease that has been related to the  bacteria and tox -
ins from root canals.

Research has also shown these bacteria and toxins to be related to arthritis, breast
tumors, gallbladder disease, eczema, torticollis, nephritis, cystitis, pernicious anemia,  colitis,   neuritis,
sinusitis, hypertension, thyroid disease, atherosclerosis, heart valve problems, myocarditis, and more.17–
20 Notice how many of these are inflammatory in nature (“itis” denotes inflammation).

According to the American Dental Association, about 15 million root canals are being per -
formed annually.

This common procedure, however, is not without risk; root-canaled teeth are often
the source of systemic toxins and are often the underlying cause of inflammation.

To appreciate why root-canaled teeth can be so dangerous, it is important to understand the
process.

A root canal is the removal of the pulpal tissue from the hollow tube within the root(s)
of the tooth.

This pulp is composed of nerves, blood, and lymphatic tissue.

Dentists are taught to
medicate the canal of the tooth during the root canal procedure to minimize the amount of bacteria
left behind.

The canal is usually packed with a latex material called gutta-percha, which suppos -
edly seals off the canal.

The underlying assumption is that the body will be able to tolerate a tooth
that now contains a minimal amount of bacteria.

The criteria for success are that a tooth does not
hurt and that it appears normal on an x-ray.

If it were just the pulp that was infected, a better out -
come could be expected.

However, the tooth’s dentin, the tooth material that surrounds the pulp, is
composed of literally millions of tiny tubules.

These tubules exist to transport nutrients to the entire
tooth.

Although we think of tooth enamel as a hard and impenetrable material, it is actually made
up of thousands of microscopic tubules.

In fact, the dentin comprises so many tubules that if the
tubules in your small lower front tooth were laid out end to end, it is estimated that they would form
a line approximately 3 miles long.

During the root-canal procedure, the canal is partially sealed with the gutta-percha or other
sealing materials, so the tooth no longer experiences the benefits from the constant cleansing 253 The Role of Dentistry in Cardiovascular Health and General Well-Being
oxygenating effect of the blood supply flowing through the tooth.

When the bacteria left behind in
the dental tubules are cut off from the normal oxygen and blood supply in this manner, they begin
to metabolize differently.

They change from an aerobic to an anaerobic form and begin to give off
potent toxins.

If your immune system is strong, your body may be able to quarantine the toxins by
“walling” off the area.

Sometimes, this may appear on an x-ray as a more radiolucent area indicat -
ing an abscess.

Dr. Weston Price, a world-renowned researcher and dentist, did 25 years of research
on the root canal issue in the 1920s and 1930s.

He had been taught, as is still taught in dental schools
today, that a radiolucent area is a bad sign.

However, Dr. Price’s research showed that a radiolucent
area might indicate a positive reaction by a healthy well-functioning immune system to the toxins
coming from a root-canaled tooth.

Sometimes the reaction is so good that a drain, called a fistula,
will open into the mouth through the gum.

This is nature’s way of expelling the toxins.

Dr. Price
considered a tooth with a radiolucent area on an x-ray less problematic than one without a radiolu -
cent area.

If your immune system cannot react effectively enough to quarantine these bacteria and
their toxins, then these toxins enter into your body as negative agents, which then attack your geneti -
cally weak systems or your areas of stress.

These bacteria are most often a form of a streptococcus.

These bacteria are most often a form of a streptococcus.

Most people in the dental profession ignored the work of Dr. Price because it was done so long
ago.

However, as previously stated, the truth always remains the truth.

Because his work was done
before the advent of antibiotics, I would argue that the role of root canals in disease is much clearer.

Dr. Price did hundreds of experiments.

In one experiment, he took extracted root-canaled teeth
from heart patients and implanted them under the skin of healthy rabbits.

The rabbits immedi -
ately developed heart disease and died.

Rabbits have an immune system similar to that of humans.

When healthy teeth were implanted under the skin of rabbits for up to a year, nothing of conse -
quence occurred.

In additional studies, Dr. Price further demonstrated how potent and insidious
root-canaled teeth could be.

Root-canaled teeth taken from patients with heart disease were ground
into a powder, which he sterilized and put through a filter to remove all bacteria.

When a miniscule
amount of that powder was injected into rabbits, they also died of heart disease.

How could it be
that root-canaled teeth seemed to cause heart disease in rabbits?

What was it in the root-canaled
teeth that caused this effect?

The answer to these questions lies in the virtually indestructible toxins
produced by the bacteria in root-canaled teeth.

It was not only heart disease that was caused by the
implanted root-canaled teeth.

Dr. Price found that if a root-canaled tooth was removed from some -
one with, for example, arthritis, and that tooth was implanted under the skin of the rabbit, the rabbit
would come down with arthritis.

Whatever disease the host had, would be the disease that would
manifest in the rabbit almost 100% of the time!

ROOT CANAL DECISIONS
To save a tooth, should a patient elect to do a root canal?

If a patient has a root-canaled tooth,
should it be removed?

Some holistic dentists believe that all root-canaled teeth should be removed.

However, I feel that the human body is too complex to look at this question in black and white.

If a
person has a strong immune system, he or she may be able to tolerate a root canal.

Another factor
to be considered is that every tooth is on an acupuncture meridian and thus each tooth relates to
specific organs, tissues, joints, muscles, and vertebrae.

This is an important factor in making the
decision as to whether or not to have a root canal performed or as to whether or not to extract an
existing root-canaled tooth.

For example, if the patient has a weak liver, a root canal on the canine
tooth, which is on the liver meridian, would be less likely to be tolerated than if that patient’s liver
were strong.

On the other hand, balancing the patient’s body chemistry and improving the function
of his or her liver, may allow the person to tolerate a root-canaled tooth on this meridian.

Dr. Price showed that inoculating rabbits with an extract of root-canaled teeth from asymptomatic
individuals usually did not produce any symptoms.

Human beings have many compensatory mech -
anisms, and I feel that to say that all root-canaled teeth must be removed in everyone is too extreme.

I have found that energetic testing via an electrodermal device (known as electroacupuncture 254 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
according to Voll [EAV] testing, which is discussed below ) is the best way to evaluate the current
status of root canals and their effect on different parts of the body.

I also use EAV testing to periodi -
cally monitor root-canaled teeth, especially if a person’s health has changed.

Let me be clear, the safest thing is to never have a root canal.

A root canal, which is being toler -
ated today, may not be tolerated at some point in the future.

287,"Chunk 287:
Let me be clear, the safest thing is to never have a root canal.

A root canal, which is being toler -
ated today, may not be tolerated at some point in the future.

However, for some people the psycho -
logical impact of removing a tooth may have more of a negative impact on their health, than the root
canal itself.

For example, telling a 20-year-old female to remove her front tooth may be too much,
psychologically, for her to handle.

It is important that the patient be educated about the possible negative effects of root canals, so
that he or she can make an informed decision.

For example, a patient of mine presented in pain with
an abscess on her upper left first molar.

She was 30 years old and had a broad smile that showed her
upper teeth all the way back to the molars.

Traditional treatment for a case like this would be a root
canal.

When I asked if anyone in her family had had breast cancer, I could see the shock in her eyes.

Her mother had died at the age of 47 of breast cancer, and her mother’s mother had died at the age
of 55 of breast cancer.

I then discussed the pros and cons of root canals and the fact that her infected
molar was on the breast meridian.

It was important that the patient be aware of this critical informa -
tion before making her decision.

It is also important that all patients be informed that a root-canaled
tooth that is currently being tolerated may, at some future time, not be tolerated as a result of age,
accident, illness, or mental trauma.

Dr. Price demonstrated that there was a greater risk of root canals creating a problem for indi -
viduals with a family history of degenerative diseases.

In many of these otherwise healthy patients,
the root canals actually trigger the onset of those diseases.

Your family’s health history is definitely
one of the considerations that must be factored in when deciding whether or not to have a root canal.

Also, you must consider the state of your own health at the time of making the decision.

If you
are chronically ill at the time you need the root canal, the wiser choice might be to have the tooth
extracted.

Donald, a physician who worked for a pharmaceutical company, had high cholesterol and high
blood pressure.

The drugs he was taking for these conditions were causing side effects.

While
researching alternative methods for resolving his problems, Donald learned that dental issues could
be contributing to his medical problems.

Donald came to see me and I noted that he had mercury
fillings and several root-canaled teeth.

His mercury fillings and root-canaled teeth did not test well.

After I removed his fillings, his cholesterol normalized.

And, after I removed his three root-canaled
teeth, Donald’s blood pressure also returned to normal.

IMPLANTS AND INFLAMMATION
Just like natural teeth, implants can carry a risk with respect to inflammation.

Similar to periodon -
titis, bone loss, called peri-implantitis, has been associated with a significant number of implants.

However, given that there are no dental tubules present in an implant, the bacterial load may be less
than that of a root-canaled tooth ( see the section on “Root Canals and the Inflammatory Process”) .

However, implants are still a potential problem.21,22
Most implants are titanium, and even though titanium is considered a very biocompatible mate -
rial, approximately 4% of those tested with the MELISA® test are allergic.

Memory lymphocyte
immunostimulation assay (MELISA) is a blood test that detects Type-IV allergy to metals, chemi -
cals, environmental toxins, and molds from one single blood sample.

Studies have shown that titanium, through a process of corrosion, goes into the cells of the body
and binds to proteins; this can produce an autoimmune reaction that can manifest as a skin rash,
chronic fatigue, muscle pain, and a host of variable symptoms.

In dentistry, if there are other met -
als present in the mouth from crowns or mercury fillings, corrosion increases.23,24 Therefore, if a
patient is going to have a titanium implant, it is preferable that there be no dissimilar metals present
in the mouth.

Often, the superstructure placed into the implant and the crown that is placed on top 255 The Role of Dentistry in Cardiovascular Health and General Well-Being
of that are composed of metals other than titanium.

This creates galvanic currents, which in turn,
have the potential to create health problems.

Thus, it is best if the superstructure and crown are
ceramic.

Ceramic implants are beginning to be used in the United States, and these will decrease
the problem of corrosion.

As stated before, every tooth and its corresponding area of the jaw are on acupuncture meridian,
which relates to specific organs, tissues, joints, muscles, and vertebrae.

Thus, one has to consider
the potential effects of placing an implant onto that meridian.

This relationship is one of the reasons
galvanic currents can have a negative effect on a person’s health.

CAVITATIONS AND INFLAMMATION
A cavitation is a hole in the bone, usually in an area where a tooth had been previously extracted and
the bone has not filled in properly.

Cavitations can occur in any bone in the body, but they are most
frequently found in the jawbones.

The most common site is the wisdom tooth area.

When a tooth is
extracted, the dentist typically leaves behind the periodontal membrane.

The periodontal membrane
is the ligamentous attachment between the tooth and the bone.

In a normal healing process, the
body fills in the space in the bone where the tooth was once located.

Some experts speculate that
if the periodontal membrane is not removed, incomplete healing occurs because the bone cells on
either side of the space “sense” the presence of the periodontal membrane and “think” that the tooth
is still there, thus not filling in the area with new bone.

This results in a hole or spongy area of bone
known as a cavitation.

However, even if an excellent surgeon performed the extraction, and even if
the membrane was removed, the patient may not heal properly.

This is especially true in the case of
individuals that are not in good health.

Recognized as far back as the 1800s, jawbone cavitations go by a number of names, such as
ischemic osteonecrosis, neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis (NICO), osteomyelitis of the
jawbone, jaw osteitis, and others.

These lesions characteristically are not painful or tender.

They are
silent and thus often go undetected.

These jawbone lesions are like cesspools; they become filled
with inflammatory bacteria and toxins.

If your body can quarantine these toxins, the effects will
be minimal.

However, if the toxins go out into your system, they can cause a myriad of symptoms
similar to root canals.

When looking at an x-ray of an extracted tooth site, one might see that the periodontal membrane
left behind forms an image that appears to be a shadow of a tooth.

When such an image is evident, it
is often an indication of the presence of a cavitation.

Most dentists are aware of this phantom tooth
image; however, they do not recognize it as a source of potential health problems.

How does one know
if this phantom image, or any suspected area, is a cavitation and if it is, what is its effect on the person?

If a patient is having facial pain such as trigeminal neuralgia, injecting a couple of drops of
anesthetic directly into the suspected area will almost immediately relieve the pain (if it is indeed
caused by the cavitation).

The relief will be temporary, but will become permanent, once the cavita -
tion is treated.

Because most cavitations are silent, do not cause facial pain, and may not be obvious on an
x-ray, it is difficult to determine if they exist.

I find that the best way to check for cavitations is
energetically .

I find that the best way to check for cavitations is
energetically .

Twenty years ago I developed a heart arrhythmia (PVCs).

While I tried natural methods like vita -
min and mineral supplementation, IV minerals, herbs and homeopathy, I did not succeed in revers -
ing the arrhythmia.

EAV evaluation ( see the section on “Electroacupuncture According to Voll” )
revealed a cavitation in my lower left wisdom tooth area.

That wisdom tooth had been extracted 25
years earlier.

Given that the wisdom teeth area is located on the heart meridian, Dr. Voll observed
in his patients a relationship between this area and heart problems.

Surgical debridement (cleaning
out) of the cavitation resolved the PVCs in a few days.

I have had no further problem since that time.

Up until the point of symptoms, my body had been able to compensate for the toxins and for the
blockage of my energy flow through this meridian .256 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
ELECTROACUPUNCTURE ACCORDING TO VOLL: HELPING TO TRACK DOWN
INFLAMMATION AND CAUSES OF INFLAMMATION ENERGETICALLY
EAV was developed out of the research of Dr. Reinhold Voll, a practicing medical doctor, anatomy
professor, acupuncturist, and homeopath.

Dr. Voll began his clinical analysis in the late 1940s.

Melding his various interests, Dr. Voll was able to scientifically document something that Chinese
acupuncturists had known for centuries—that there are, in the human body, points on the skin
having high levels of electrical conduction (less resistance), and that these points are known as
acupuncture points.

Fascinated by his confirmation of the existence of these energy pathways,
Dr. Voll developed a simple metering device to measure the skin resistance over acupuncture points.

This important component of the EAV device is basically an ohmmeter, which measures electron
flow in a circuit.

The meter has a metal cylinder attached at one end and a stylus attached at the
other end.

A small amount of current enters through the cylinder.

Thus, if the stylus is touched to
the cylinder, the reading on the meter will go to 100.

This means that there is no resistance and there
is a completed circuit.

Dr. Voll had his patients hold a small brass cylinder in one hand.

Then he would touch the tip of
the stylus to a specific acupuncture point.

The stylus would introduce a minute amount of electrical
current that would travel through the body to reach the cylinder thus forming a complete electri -
cal circuit.

The amount of skin resistance at the acupuncture site would then be recorded.

Dr. Voll
found normal skin resistance over a healthy acupuncture point to be 100,000 Ω.

This equals 50 on
the Voll galvanic skin response scale.

As previously mentioned, the human body is not just a physical being; it simultaneously operates
via a series of electrical impulses that have been shown to follow certain pathways.

These pathways
can be accessed at various points on the skin, where there are changes in the electrical resistance
or the ability of the tissue to conduct electricity.

During 40 years of research Dr. Voll documented,
throughout the body, an entire network of these energetic pathways, better known as energy merid -
ians.

Many correspond to traditional acupuncture meridians; many are new.

He was also able to
establish that each meridian acted like a “highway” for energy, connecting specific teeth, organs,
tissues, and in fact, everything in the body.

A healthy pathway can sustain a certain level of electron flow.

Inflammation tends to foster
increased activity in the cells, thereby creating a more active environment through which elec -
trons flow at a greater rate.

Thus, if inflammation exists anywhere along the meridian pathway,

Thus, if inflammation exists anywhere along the meridian pathway,
the EAV testing will show a higher-than-average flow of electrons, as indicated by a reading of
greater than 50.

Degenerative states cause cellular activity to slow and stagnate, making it more difficult for elec -
trons to flow through the circuit.

In such a state, the EAV testing would reveal a reading less than
50.

Dr. Voll found that the most significant information he derived from EAV testing was revealed
when the electron flow dropped from an initial reading to a lower reading.

For example, a situa -
tion wherein the initial reading may be 55, but then drops to 35; this pattern indicates that a circuit,
which was formerly capable of sustaining electron flow, is no longer able to do so.

This type of drop
evidences a disturbance in the circuit.

Dr. Voll called this fall in reading an Indicator Drop.

Because the body consists of an energetic “web” of relationships, the major circuits have sec -
ondary and tertiary circuits connecting virtually all parts of the body.

A highly skilled practitioner
of EAV testing can establish a cause–effect relationship between any two points on the body.

The
use of EAV testing provides critical information that assists the practitioner in choosing the correct
treatments to help a patient heal.

Because every major organ and, in fact, nearly everything in the human body is linked via merid -
ians to a specific tooth and tooth area, the implications of EAV testing in a whole body approach
to dentistry is exciting.

For instance, EAV test results may indicate a hypothyroid condition, which
might be caused by a cavitation in the upper first molar area, which is on the thyroid meridian.

This type of early warning should be followed by traditional thyroid function testing to see if the 257 The Role of Dentistry in Cardiovascular Health and General Well-Being
condition has reached a physical point, where blood tests indicate a problem.

However, it is impor -
tant to remember that energetic changes always precede physical changes.

Truly, preventive treat -
ment would always begin as energy imbalances manifest; in this case, treatment would start before
the problem shows up at a physical level in a blood test.

The fact that every tooth is on an acupuncture meridian, which relates to specific organs and
tissues, is very important in helping to diagnose a problem with an individual tooth.

Sometimes
teeth are treated with a root canal or with an extraction (because the patient has pain), with the
result being no resolution of the pain.

For example, a patient presented with terrible pain in an
upper canine (eye) tooth.

At first it seemed obvious that a root canal or extraction was necessary.

However, EAV testing revealed that a problem in the gallbladder was the underlying cause of the
pain.

Treatment of the gallbladder issue relieved the tooth pain.

EAV testing provides a phenomenal amount of information about the nature of what is happening
in the body.

It is an exceptional tool for helping to identify the type of traditional diagnostic testing
that might be appropriate to confirm one’s own suspicions as to what is occurring.

EAV equipment has also been used for allergy testing, and one study has actually shown EAV
to be as accurate, or more accurate, than other forms of allergy testing.25 EAV testing allows the
practitioner to learn whether two seemingly unrelated symptoms in the body are indeed connected
to one another.

EAV screening provides invaluable information about the patient’s energetic “web” or currents
and helps the practitioner determine the location of “energetic stressors” that are creating blockages
or disturbances in the natural flow of energy.

The stressors themselves can be anything alien to or
out of balance in the body.

They may include any foreign material implanted in the body, like fill -
ings, crowns, implants, or root-canaled teeth.

They may include any foreign material implanted in the body, like fill -
ings, crowns, implants, or root-canaled teeth.

They may also emanate from issues involving sinuses,
tonsils, impacted teeth, periodontal disease, cavitations, or various toxins.

Even scars located on
different parts of the body can act as stressors, affecting import meridians.

Stressors create a field of disturbance in the energetic web of the body.

These fields of distur -
bance are most often in the head, because the mouth is where we most frequently have procedures
performed.

The results of such disturbances can be felt anywhere in the body and can actually block
the effectiveness of any treatment.

Each individual has his or her own tolerance level for stressors.

The range of responses to stress -
ors is truly incredible.

Certainly, factors such as diet, exercise, state of mind, genetics, and general
well-being play an important role in how well a person’s system can tolerate the stressors.

Ironically, a mishap at a presentation of EAV technology by Dr. Voll resulted in the discovery of
one of EAV’s most powerful abilities.

Dr. Voll was giving a demonstration on a patient who had a
large indicator drop on his prostate point.

During a break, a helpful homeopath from the audience
approached the patient and offered him a homeopathic remedy.

The patient gratefully put the vial of
medication in his pocket.

After the break Dr. Voll resumed his demonstration with the same patient,
but now found that the readings on the prostate point were normal.

After several confusing and somewhat embarrassing minutes of questioning his subject, Dr. Voll
discovered the homeopath’s remedy.

Although the remedy was in a container in the patient’s pocket,
it was able to influence the readings.

In fact, he discovered that the remedy influenced the readings
even when it was simply held near enough to be in the patient’s energy field.

When the remedy was
removed beyond the patient’s energy field, the reading again indicated an energetic imbalance of
the prostate.

This event ultimately led to one of the most interesting discoveries relating to meridians.

It also
provided a spectacular demonstration of how the human energy field does indeed extend beyond
the boundaries of the physical body.

In the following years, Dr. Voll developed a sophisticated
means of selecting proper homeopathic remedies and various other substances based on EAV
readings.

He would place homeopathic remedies, vitamins, foods, and so on on a tray, which was
in the circuit, to test their effects on the meridian readings.

This method was very laborious but
effective.258 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Modern EAV units are computerized, and the testing that Dr. Voll did manually is now much
faster and more simplified.

Although Dr. Voll needed the physical remedy or supplement, we now
only need the frequency of what is being tested.

Everything has its own unique energy signal or
“energetic fingerprint,” such as homeopathic remedies, foods, drugs, chemicals, and pesticides.

Just
as one can take one’s voice frequency, digitalize it, and place it on a CD, one can take the energetic
signal of anything and place it on a disk.

Over the years, the energetic signals of countless sub -
stances have been entered into various EAV software programs, resulting in thousands of “virtual”
bottles, so that the actual physical matter being tested is no longer necessary.

EAV is a wonderful instrument to help track down inflammation and causes of inflammation.

Various toxins, such as pesticides or chemicals to which people are generally exposed, are often
associated with inflammation.

EAV testing allows one to evaluate whether or not particular sub -
stances present a problem, quantify the level of the problem, and track progress while removing
those toxins from the body.

EAV testing allows one to evaluate whether or not particular sub -
stances present a problem, quantify the level of the problem, and track progress while removing
those toxins from the body.

Many practitioners are very skeptical of this type of testing because
these concepts are based on the principles of energy rather than on the mechanical model, with
which we are more familiar.

However, for more than 20 years, I have clinically observed the suc -
cessful results of this type of testing.

Therapy localization can be used to determine if a tooth, or if a cavitation, relates to a specific
problem.

For example, to discover whether or not a root canaled tooth on a lower right second molar
is related to a chronic sinus problem, the following will be done.

Using the hand holding the brass
rod, the patient will place the index finger of this hand onto the root-canaled tooth.

The tester will
then place the stylus on various acupuncture points on the free hand, including the sinus point.

If
the root-canaled tooth is a problem for this patient, readings will change from the baseline read -
ings (what they are without touching the root-canaled tooth).

As an example, let us say there was
an indicator drop on the sinus point when getting a baseline reading.

This indicator drop signifies
a problem in the sinus.

If the patient therapy localizes to the root-canaled tooth and now we have
no indicator drop on the sinus point, this indicates a cause-and-effect relationship; the root canal
is having an effect on the sinus.

One can then even output signals to see if bacteria from the root-
canaled tooth are a problem and/or if other types of toxins (such as thioethers) are emanating from
the dead tooth.

This same method can be used to determine if the root-canaled tooth relates to a
heart valve problem.

The use of EAV is also helpful in nutritional assessment.

Supplements can be tested separately to
see if each is compatible with the patient.

Also, groupings of supplements can be tested at the same
time, to see if they test well for the patient when taken together.

It is not uncommon for supplements
that test well individually, to not test well, when taken together as a particular grouping.

Thus,
various permutations of the prescribed supplements can be tested so that they are taken in optimal
combinations.

BEYOND THE PHYSICAL: THE ENERGETIC LEVEL
The things that I have discussed thus far all have an inflammatory effect.

It is important to manage
these and to rid the body of these dental stressors.

There are many other stressors; these include
chemicals or pesticides, mold, parasites, and so on.

It is important to address all of them.

These can
all be handled at a physical level, in other words, by doing things physically to remove them from
the body.

For instance, we can remove the mercury fillings, we can treat the periodontal disease and
we can detoxify the body.

However, is this enough?

What is there beyond this?

I have observed that just a few mercury fillings or one root canal can have devastating effects on
some people, while others are seemingly unaffected.

Some people can be bitten by a tick, known
to be carrying the Lyme bacteria, and remain Lyme free, even without antibiotics, while other
people’s health is forever changed, even with antibiotics.

It all comes down to the resistance of the
host.

That resistance is composed of many different factors.

I liken it to a balance scale.

On one side
of the scale is optimal health, on the other side are all those things opposing optimal health, both 259 The Role of Dentistry in Cardiovascular Health and General Well-Being
the physical and nonphysical.

Many things will weigh down the bad side of the scale.

Many things will weigh down the bad side of the scale.

The physical
negatives include chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, a bad structural relationship between the
mandible and maxilla, impacted teeth, dead teeth, cavitations, infected tonsils, scars, poor nutri -
tion, an out-of-balance acid–base level, a bad heart valve, or a bad hip.

As we have discussed, these
can be addressed at a physical level, and it is important that this be done.

Unloading the physical
stressors is straightforward and can substantially improve a person’s health.

A person may feel so
much better that it seems as if nothing more needs to be done.

Yet, if we look closely, there may
still remain symptoms of grief or anxiety, digestive complaints, and so on.

Then there are those
people that have always felt well.

We all know people who exercise, eat nutritiously, do not have
a particularly stressful job or home life, feel well, and yet develop heart disease, cancer, or some
other debilitating problem such as, for example, arthritis.

If you question them, they will say that
they were perfectly healthy up to this point of illness.

However, if one looks more deeply, this is not
the case.

They all had symptoms.

Often there were small problems that did not interfere with their
lifestyle and tended to be ignored.

These symptoms are the “voice of nature.

They call out to us.

These are the keys to unlocking a path to a much higher level of health.

In such instances, we are
at an energetic or vibrational level, the world of frequencies.

There are different ways to access this
level.

One can approach it by dealing with the individual symptoms, as if one tuned only the violins
in a symphony orchestra.

As the violins are tuned, the sound of the instruments will become harmo -
nious, with each note resonating with the universal note it is tuned to.

There are a number of ways
to tune into these aberrant frequencies.

Different holistic modalities such as color therapy, music
therapy, Rife machines, and homeopathic remedies are among a group of treatment modalities that
can change frequencies and alleviate symptoms.

However, other instruments in the orchestra may
also be out of tune.

If we could magically tune all the instruments in an orchestra with a master
frequency, we could then create a beautiful symphony of sound.

This is where I find homeopathy to
be invaluable.

Homeopathy can tune many instruments at one time.

When that is done, many of the
patient’s symptoms will fall by the wayside.

To better understand how homeopathy works, we need
to understand its underlying principles.

What are the foundational principles?

First is the law of “like cures like.” The substance that will cause symptoms in a healthy person
will take away those same symptoms in a sick person.

Allergy shots are based on this concept of
“like cures like.” Unlike homeopathy, the shots actually give you a small amount of the allergen to
which you are allergic, to desensitize you.

Second is the law of “potentization,” which relates to the releasing of the inner energy of a sub -
stance.

Unlike an allergy shot, a homeopathic remedy has no physical substance; it is an energetic
signal or energetic vibration.

Another foundational principle of homeopathy is that symptoms are a manifestation between
what Dr. Samuel Hahnemann called the “vital force” and something external such as a toxin or
chronic infection.

Inherited traits or what Dr. Hahnemann called miasms, today we would refer to them as our
genetic predispositions.

Dr. Hahnemann found miasms to be the underlying cause of all chronic dis -
eases.

These miasms represent the core from which various symptoms emerge.

The symptoms are

These miasms represent the core from which various symptoms emerge.

The symptoms are
given names like eczema, herpes, arthritis, heart disease, colitis, and so on.

Looking at a patient’s
list of external symptoms (nature’s voice), along with an understanding of the underlying miasms,
the physician can find a specific homeopathic remedy, which can begin the process of true cure.

It is also extremely important to understand the fundamental truth about suppression of symp -
toms.

Suppressing symptoms does not cure the underlying disease.

Instead, the illness is driven
deeper into the body until it manifests in another way.

By the time a person exhibits pathology (an
identifiable physical change), that person has probably been suffering for a long time.

By “suffering”
I mean that there have been symptoms, which were subtly or nonsubtly, crying out for treatment.

Those symptoms may have been nagging and persistent, or they may have been symptoms that deal
with the senses (ones for which modern medicine has no answers).

For instance, a person may be
affected by the phases of the moon.

Another may catch cold whenever his or her chest is exposed 260 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
to a draft.

Others may have an altered sense of taste or be sensitive to smells.

A child may have dif -
ficulty controlling his temper.

These are the beginnings of what will follow.

If not addressed in their
early stages, these seemingly innocuous symptoms will eventually manifest themselves as external
symptoms that modern medicine will now name and treat with a drug, which will suppress those
symptoms.

From a homeopathic perspective, these beginning changes are vibrational in nature;
therefore, homeopathic remedies, which themselves are vibrational, should be used to treat them.

The homeopathic remedy chosen should be based on the totality of symptoms, both physical and
emotional.

Dr. Hahnemann also talked about “exciting” causes of the underlying miasms.

Exciting causes
are external stressors that can bring latent miasms to the surface or prevent a cure.

Given that emo -
tional stress, poor diet, toxins, drugs, and so on, can all be exciting causes, it is particularly impor -
tant to treat both the physical and the nonphysical.

In summary, I feel that symptoms are nature’s voice calling out to us.

We need to answer nature’s
call.

To do this, we must view dentistry in a global manner and address not only the problems in
the mouth but also everything related to the mouth.

It is not enough to treat inflammation.

We need
to address what is present even before inflammation.

In other words, we need to treat the whole
body.

This approach leads not only to better oral health but also to better cardiovascular and general
health.

Dr. Willy Burgdorfer identified the spirochete (spiral-shaped
bacteria) Borrelia  burgdorferi  as the infectious agent.2 It is now known that there are about a dozen
other genetically related species in addition to the B. burgdorferi  spirochete that can cause Lyme
disease symptoms, especially Borrelia  afzelii  and Borrelia  garinii .

These species of spirochetes are
collectively referred to as Borrelia  burgdorferi  sensu  lato, and they can be transmitted to humans
from various animals by various species of ticks.3 There are also a variety of microbial coinfec -
tions carried by the same ticks that transmit B. burgdorferi  sensu  lato to humans and, often, these
coinfections are transmitted to humans at the same time as the Borrelia .

These coinfections include
Anaplasma  phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia chaffeensis , and Coxiella burnetii , as well as a variety of
other Rickettsia  (bacteria-like microbes); some Bartonella  bacterial species; some Babesia  proto -
zoa species; various Mycoplasma  bacterial species; certain worms (such as Varestrongylus  klapowi )
and, according to one European Borrelia  researcher, also some Chlamydia  species, Yersinia  entero -
colitica , Campylobacter  jejuni , and human parvovirus B19.4 When a person has coinfections along
with Borrelia , it becomes much more complicated to make a proper, comprehensive diagnosis and
to treat the person.

DIAGNOSING LYME DISEASE AND COINFECTIONS
Standards for diagnosing and treating borreliosis and some of its coinfections have been published
by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).6 Diagnosing Borrelia  and all of the coin -
fections can be very challenging.

The physical diagnostic hallmark of borreliosis is an erythema
migrans (EM) skin rash (Figure 11.1) in a patient who has been bitten by a tick.

However, a medical
literature search revealed that at least 19% of U.S. Borrelia  patients did not have an EM rash and
many could not recall having been bitten by a tick.7 Two practitioners in Houston, Texas (which is not
considered an endemic area for Lyme disease), reported in 2003 that most of their 455 chronically
ill patients who had symptoms in multiple systems of their bodies tested positive for B. burgdorferi
after repeat Western blot or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, even though two-thirds of
them tested negative on the first test.8 On the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website,9
there is a helpful diagram to aid physicians in diagnosing Borrelia .

If the patient’s symptoms suggest
the possibility of borreliosis, the first test that they should do is a blood enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
or a blood immunofluorescence assay (IFA).

Only if one of those first tests is positive should a more

Only if one of those first tests is positive should a more
specific blood test be done: a Western blot.

If the initial EIA/IFA is negative and the signs/symptoms
have persisted for greater than 30 days, an unspecified alternative diagnosis should be considered.

The incidence of false-negative blood tests in patients with the most advanced stage of Borrelia
(called neuroborreliosis, meaning brain and/or spinal cord involvement) may be as high as 15%10
because only B. burgdorferi  is usually tested, rather than testing as well for the other species of
Borrelia  that can also commonly cause neuroborreliosis.

Another reason for false-negative blood
tests in Lyme patients is the presence or absence of certain human leukocyte antigens (the white
blood cell proteins HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR7).11 Furthermore, Lyme patients who have active live
spirochetes in their joints and cerebrospinal fluid tend to have low or negative Borrelia  antibodies in
their serum,12 which suggests that an excess of microbial antigens, resulting from rapidly  growing
microbes, might be overwhelming the immune system, forming immune complexes (which are
not tested by most tests) and thus creating a negative antibody test.

If Lyme disease test results are

suspected to be false negative, it is a good idea to do a repeat test after a few weeks and also possibly
test for B. afzelii  and B. garinii  or even some of the other less common Borrelia  species in addition
to B. burgdorferi .

Testing for HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR7 may also be useful.

HOW LYME BORRELIOSIS AND COINFECTIONS CREATE MULTISYSTEM ILLNESS
Borreliosis often causes illness in many systems of the body, and several or all of the following
conditions/symptoms can be found in the same patient: fatigue, fever, headaches, neuropathy, spinal
nerve pain, inflammation in the eye, muscle pains, joint pains, skin rashes, lymph node swelling,
various heart problems, gastrointestinal complaints, urinary symptoms, and even Guillain-Bare
syndrome (a body-wide paralysis).4 Borrelia  is known as a great imitator, meaning that it imitates
many different conditions.

In fact, there are over 300 medical conditions linked to borreliosis by
cause or by association.13 Unfortunately, several of the common Lyme coinfections can cause many
of the same conditions as Borrelia ,4,14–18 making it difficult to know whether Borrelia  or other
coinfections (or both Borrelia  and the coinfections) are causing the ongoing symptoms after a usual
treatment course for the microbes that were identified on the initial testing.

In some cases, one or
more of the coinfections are initially present without Borrelia  and are not suspected by the treating
practitioner because the patient did not have an EM rash.

Blood testing for all of the possible coin -
fections is almost impossible because there are so many species that could be causing the symptoms
and tests for some of the species are not readily available.

One solution to this dilemma is to do electrodermal screening (EDS) for the various suspected
microbes.

EDS, developed in Germany in the 1950s by Dr. Voll,19 is like a lie-detector test, measur -
ing galvanic skin response to a stressor20; but instead of the voice of a policeman being the stressor,
the vibrational frequency of a microbe, toxin, or some other substance (generated by the EDS
device) is the potential stressor.

The frequency of a microbe that has never affected the patient will
not create an abnormal galvanic skin response, but the frequency of a microbe recently  affecting
the patient will almost always produce an abnormal galvanic skin response.

So, EDS is a useful
data-gathering device used by many integrative medicine practitioners, but EDS does not make
a diagnosis.

So, EDS is a useful
data-gathering device used by many integrative medicine practitioners, but EDS does not make
a diagnosis.

It provides additional useful data, which a skilled integrative practitioner can factor
into the patient’s history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures to make
a diagnosis.

The EDS can also be used with fairly good accuracy to help predict which therapies
might be helpful to consider for a specific patient and which therapies would likely produce an unde -
sirable response in the patient.

Some integrative practitioners also use some form of muscle testing
to gather additional data that might assist in the diagnosis of Lyme disease and coinfections and to
determine which therapies might be effective and which ones might be ineffective or potentially
harmful for the patient.

OVERVIEW OF LYME EFFECTS ON THE HEART
Borrelia  and all of the aforementioned coinfections (other than possibly Anaplasma  and Ehrlichia )
can cause heart disease.

The most recent review of Lyme disease and the heart in peer-reviewed med -
ical literature21 failed to mention that coinfections and even other Borrelia  species (besides B. burg-
dorferi  sensu  stricto ) can cause heart disease.

For this reason, physicians who are trying to offer the
most help possible to their patients should educate themselves thoroughly about the effects that these
microbes have on the heart and not rely on just one article for information.

Studies published about
30 years ago revealed that carditis (inflammation of the heart) occurred in 4%–10% of untreated
U.S. Lyme disease patients and even more than that if asymptomatic carditis was included22 but
that it occurred in only 0.3%–4% of European Lyme patients.23 With more physicians recognizing
Lyme disease and starting antibiotic therapy at earlier stages of the disease, Lyme carditis, which is
a late-stage manifestation of Lyme, has become less common in endemic areas of the United States.

But because many physicians still believe that Lyme disease can only occur near Lyme, Connecticut 266  Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
with an associated EM rash, there are still people with unrecognized/undiagnosed Lyme disease
who have carditis, especially in nonendemic areas.

The most common cardiac indication that someone has Lyme carditis is atrioventricular (AV)
block.

The AV block is a condition in which there is impaired electrical conduction in the heart
from the upper chambers (atria) to the lower chambers (ventricles) through the AV node (specialized
electrical conducting cells between the heart chambers).

Because severe AV block often results in a
heart rate so slow that passing out can occur, this sometimes requires the patient to wear a tempo -
rary pacemaker for a few days while the carditis that caused the AV block is resolved with a course
of appropriate antibiotics.24,25 A permanent pacemaker is very rarely ever needed for Lyme carditis
as the antibiotics usually resolve the AV block.

There are various other heart conditions/problems that may also be caused by Lyme disease.

Junctional tachycardia26 and fascicular tachycardia27 are fast, abnormal heart rhythms that  originate
from the Lyme-induced inflammation in the electrical conducting tissue between the two lower
(ventricular) chambers of the heart.

Lyme can also cause mild left ventricular dysfunction and even
rare cardiomegaly (heart chamber enlargement often with insufficient blood being pumped out of
the heart with each beat).28 Acute myopericarditis is an inflammation in the heart muscle and in
the sac around the entire heart (the pericardium) that can be caused by Lyme.28 This pericardial
inflammation often results in fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac, which can then put such
severe pressure on the heart chambers that they cannot adequately fill with blood during each
beat of the heart and this can even be fatal.28 Much less common ways in which Lyme affects the
heart are endocarditis (an inflammation of one or more of the heart valves and inner lining of the
heart)29 and sick sinus syndrome (a disease process in the primary heart rhythm regulating center
that causes the heart to beat much too fast at times and much too slowly at other times).30 Also,
supraventricular tachycardia (a very fast abnormal heart rhythm from the upper heart chambers)
and even ventricular tachycardia (a very fast abnormal heart rhythm from the lower heart chambers)
are other heart conditions rarely seen with Lyme carditis.31 So patients with arrhythmias are often
evaluated for coronary artery disease as a cause of the arrhythmia, but very rarely does a cardiolo -
gist think to look for Lyme disease as a cause.

And if a blood test is done to look for Lyme disease,
there is probably less than a 50% chance that the blood test will find Borrelia , even if it is the cause
of the arrhythmia.

It is important to remember that no tick bite or EM rash is necessary for Lyme
disease to be the cause of an arrhythmia or other cardiac condition.

And it is also important to
understand the difficulties in diagnosing Lyme disease so that a person’s cardiac condition is not
attributed to something else.

When Lyme carditis has persisted for many weeks to months before diagnosis and treatment, a
cardiomyopathy can develop.

Cardiomyopathy is a generalized weakening of the heart muscle com -
monly associated with enlargement (dilation) of the heart chambers and with shortness of breath on
minimal exertion and sometimes even at rest (especially when lying flat in bed at night).

Advanced
cardiomyopathy can easily result in congestive heart failure, which usually necessitates hospitaliza -
tion.

An Austrian study found that 26% of cardiomyopathy patients tested positive for B.  burgdorferi ,
whereas only 8% of healthy blood donors tested positive.32 In one research study in Prague, Czech
Republic, heart muscle biopsies were done on patients with and without dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM).33 In the DCM group, 24% of the heart biopsies were positive for B.  burgdorferi , B. afzelii ,
or B. garinii  but none in the control group (those with no DCM).

In Warsaw, Poland, diseased
hearts that were removed during heart transplantation were analyzed and found to have the DNA
of Borrelia  species, as well as some Lyme coinfections: Coxiella  and Bartonella .34 There are case
reports of DCM in patients with known, or strongly suspected, B. burgdorferi  infection whose
DCM resolved after treatment with high-dose penicillin or ceftriaxone antibiotic.35,36 This strongly
suggests B. burgdorferi  as the cause of the DCM in those cases.

There is one fascinating case
report of a 47-year-old woman who was given ceftriaxone antibiotic for fever, EM rash, shortness of
breath, and passing out from complete AV heart block.37 She had such a severe Herxheimer reaction
(rapid toxin buildup from rapid microbe die-off) in her heart that she developed a life-threatening, 267 Lyme Disease and the Heart
very rapid heart rhythm and cardiogenic shock (very low blood pressure from heart failure).

This
required aggressive life support in the hospital to keep her alive.

This
required aggressive life support in the hospital to keep her alive.

With 28 days of antibiotic therapy
for Lyme disease, she recovered fully and the pumping function of her left ventricle (main heart
pumping chamber) rose from 10% to 61% (normal is 55%–65%).

THERAPY FOR LYME CARDITIS IN GENERAL
If a patient has apparent Lyme carditis and chest pain, shortness of breath, passing out, or AV block,
they should be hospitalized and continually monitored.6 A temporary pacemaker may be required
for advanced AV block, but a permanent pacemaker is very rarely ever needed.

For Lyme carditis
conditions that are severe enough to require hospitalization, an intravenous antibiotic, such as ceftri -
axone, is recommended as an initial treatment; then once the patient’s condition has improved suf -
ficiently, the remainder of a 14- to 21-day treatment course can be completed with an oral antibiotic.6
As seen in the cardiogenic shock case previously described, very aggressive and invasive therapies
must be used occasionally to save a patient’s life, but fortunately such therapies are rarely needed
for people with Lyme carditis.

And the various Lyme carditis conditions usually resolve fully with
appropriate antibiotic therapy.

PHARMACEUTICAL ANTIBIOTIC RESEARCH IN LYME
A research study that was done on patients with Lyme disease, in which the patients were given trial
treatments of antibiotics, revealed that tetracycline was more effective than penicillin and erythro -
mycin for treating the EM rash, which occurs in early-stage Lyme disease.

The patients who were
treated with tetracycline had no major late-stage manifestations or complications from the illness,
such as carditis, encephalitis (brain inflammation), or recurrent attacks of arthritis, but late-stage
complications occurred in 7%–14% of the patients in the other two groups.38 In 1990, patients who
were given the combination of amoxicillin and probenecid for treating the EM Lyme rash had just as
favorable results as those patients who were given doxycycline (a long-acting tetracycline antibiotic).

This combination of antibiotics was also just as effective for preventing late-stage complications of
Lyme disease.39 Cephalexin was ineffective in treating early Lyme,40 but cefuroxime was found to
be as effective as doxycycline in treating early (EM rash) Lyme patients.41 In treating early Lyme
patients, however, azithromycin was less effective than amoxicillin.42 Cefuroxime and amoxicillin
were both found to be safe and effective for treating children 6 months to 12 years old with early
Lyme disease43 as tetracycline and doxycycline cause dental abnormalities and cannot be used in
children.

A study in 1997 found intravenous or intramuscular ceftriaxone equivalent to doxycycline
in treating acute disseminated Lyme disease.44 One study45 found that for early Lyme there was
no better 30-month outcome in those treated with 20 days of doxycycline, or 2 g of intravenous
ceftriaxone followed by 10 days of doxycycline, compared to only 10 days of doxycycline (100 mg
twice daily), but there was a four times greater risk of diarrhea in those given ceftriaxone.

So, in
summary, 10 days of doxycycline twice daily by mouth, or intravenous/intramuscular ceftriaxone, is
the preferred treatment for adult Lyme patients and oral amoxicillin or cefuroxime is the preferred
treatment for children.

LYME TREATMENT GUIDELINES FROM THE INFECTIOUS
DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA
The Lyme treatment guidelines were published by the IDSA in 2006.6 The IDSA recommended
only 14–28 days of pharmaceutical antibiotics for treatment whether the Lyme disease presented as
acute EM or as late-stage disease with central nervous system involvement or very-late-stage arthri -

Intravenous antibiotics were 268  Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
reserved for involvement of the heart, central nervous system, or peripheral nerves.

The IDSA arti -
cle6 also said that “because of a lack of biologic plausibility, lack of efficacy, absence of supporting
data, or the potential for harm to the patient” several therapies were not recommended for the treat -
ment of Lyme disease, including various specific pharmaceutical antibiotics, “pulsed-dosing … ,
long-term antibiotic therapy, anti- Bartonella  therapies, hyperbaric oxygen, ozone, fever therapy,
intravenous immunoglobulin, cholestyramine, intravenous hydrogen peroxide, specific nutritional
supplements, and others … .” It may be logical to avoid a few of these strategies/treatments, such as
the antibiotics that are unproved in studies, like first-generation cephalosporins (the first antibiot -
ics ever developed in this class of drugs), but recommendations to avoid other treatments/therapies
are not logical or reasonable.

For example, if a patient with advanced cardiomyopathy is proved,
by appropriate testing, to have Bartonella  myocarditis  or endocarditis (with or without Borrelia ),
then the Bartonella  should be treated with some of these other “forbidden” antibiotics to reduce
the risk of the patient having to have a valve replacement or heart transplant.34 Also, if objective
testing proves that a patient with Lyme disease has a nutritional deficiency, it could be considered
malpractice to withhold the needed nutrients from him or her.

Certain nutrients are harmless and
have a low risk of side effects, but they are likely to improve the patient’s immune function or the
production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy to the body so that it can heal.

For example, 57% of the U.S. population ingests less magnesium than what is recommended by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture.46 Therefore, more than half of the population should be taking a
magnesium nutritional supplement to maintain their health.

This contradicts the aforementioned
IDSA guidelines, which recommend avoiding such nutrients.

PHARMACEUTICAL TREATMENT FOR LATE-STAGE LYME DISEASE
The most common late-stage manifestations of Lyme disease are Lyme arthritis, Lyme DCM, ACA
(a chronic inflammatory skin condition predominantly in the hands and feet), Lyme encephalomy -
elitis (an inflammation in the brain and spinal cord), and Lyme peripheral neuropathy (a loss of
sensation in the feet, legs, and sometimes hands caused by Borrelia ).

The ACA and DCM are both
rare in the United States but a bit more common in Europe.

A study has shown that Lyme arthritis
can be healed by 28–30 days of oral doxycycline or amoxicillin.

Lyme arthritis that is resistant to
28–30 days of oral therapy may be treated with intravenous or intramuscular ceftriaxone 2 g/day
for 14 days.47 Intravenous or intramuscular ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 14–28 days is reported to be the
best treatment for neurological Lyme disease48 and usually helps to resolve other chronic manifesta -
tions of Lyme disease at the same time.

Research by Judith Miklossy49 has demonstrated that 25%
of all Alzheimer’s dementia cases are likely caused by B. burgdorferi  infections and most of the
remainder of the cases by other spirochetal bacteria that are commonly found in the human mouth.

A prospective study has not yet been done though to determine if Alzheimer’s dementia can be
reversed by antimicrobial treatment.

INEFFECTIVENESS OF ANTIBIOTICS TO RESOLVE LATE-STAGE LYME SYMPTOMS
A fairly recent study was done on 63 Lyme patients who 6 months prior had been treated with
antibiotics by following the IDSA guidelines6 for short-term antibiotic treatment.

After finishing
treatment, 36% of these patients reported new-onset fatigue; 20% widespread pain; and 45% new dif -
ficulties with memory, focus, and concentration.50 According to the IDSA guidelines, these patients
should be labeled as having “posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome” (PTLDS).

Interestingly, less
than 10% of these patients reported greater than minimal depression across the entire testing period.

The IDSA would say that their symptoms are a result of delayed immune reactions to the Borrelia
antigens and that they do not have any active ongoing infections, but there may be another expla -
nation.

After B. burgdorferi  is exposed for a few hours to antibiotics that are commonly used to
treat Lyme disease, the spiral-shaped B. burgdorferi  microbe forms several tiny blebs or granules 269 Lyme Disease and the Heart
along its length (Figure 11.2).51 When spiral-shaped B. burgdorferi  are placed into cerebrospinal
fluid for a few hours, they also transform into these same small spherical forms (bleb, granule,
or cystic form) and when those spherical bleb forms are moved from the cerebrospinal fluid to a
BSK-H culture medium it takes more than 9 days for the B. burgdorferi  to transform back into the
spiral-shaped invasive form.52 These B. burgdorferi  blebs appear to contain all the DNA  materials
necessary to form an entirely new spiral-shaped bacteria when the noxious conditions resolve.

These B.  burgdorferi  blebs also appear to be very resistant to any effect from standard antibiotics
used to treat Borrelia  according to IDSA guidelines.

B. burgdorferi  can also form biofilms (a matrix
of complex sugar chains and other substances much like the thick, sticky human nasal secretions),
which can envelope and shield the microbes hiding inside the biofilm from immune attack or anti -
biotic penetration.53 When five different antibiotics were tested against Borrelia  in bacterial culture
tubes in the laboratory at the University of New Haven, Connecticut, it was found that many of the
Borrelia  blebs survived all five of the tested antibiotics and that the antibiotics also only reduced
the Borrelia  biofilm forms by 30%–55%.54 The same research group found that a combination of
Banderol and Samento (two Peruvian rain forest herbs) was able to significantly reduce the num -
ber of B. burgdorferi  bleb forms and essentially eliminate all B. burgdorferi  biofilms, much more
effectively than the doxycycline antibiotic.55 These same types of bleb forms of B. burgdorferi  were
found in the cerebrospinal fluid of all 10 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients in a study in Norway56
but in only 1 of the 5 control patients without MS (and that 1 control patient had suffered from EM
rash typical of Borrelia  infection).

When the cerebrospinal fluid samples from the MS patients were
cultured, 2 out of the 10 grew spiral-shaped, rodlike microbes resembling Borrelia .

In a study with B. burgdorferi –infected mice, 3 months after treating with ceftriaxone  antibiotic
the mice’s infection status was assessed by culture.57 Joint tissue and heart tissue from these
antibiotic-treated mice were transplanted under the skin (subcutaneously) into immune-deficient
(SCID) mice who had no Borrelia .

Even though the cultures were negative for Borrelia  in the
antibiotic-treated mice, various tissue samples that were collected from the SCID mice who had
received the subcutaneously transplanted joint and heart tissue taken from the antibiotic-treated
mice were positive for Borrelia  DNA.

This demonstrated that the Borrelia  microbes remained alive
and infectious after antibiotic treatment, but apparently they were more slowly reproducing than
Borrelia  that had never been treated with antibiotics.

AN HERBAL PROGRAM MAY HELP MANY LYME PATIENTS
In 2003, I asked the question, “Can natural (non-pharmaceutical) therapies make a difference in
chronically-ill Lyme patients with co-infections who have already been treated with antibiotics but
who are given no hope of improvement by conventional Lyme-literate medical doctors?” Some other
practitioners worked with me that year on a study in Dallas, Texas, to answer that question.

Thirteen
gravely ill Lyme patients with coinfections were treated for 18 weeks with a combination of natural
remedies (predominantly herbal and nutritional).

The 14 comparably ill Lyme patients with coin -
fections who served as controls in the study were treated during those 18 weeks with the best stan -
dard medical care possible from a Lyme-literate neurologist.

All 13 of the natural treatment Lyme
patients and the 14 other control Lyme patients had been previously treated with several courses
of antibiotics for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive and Western blot-positive
neuroborreliosis ( Borrelia  in the brain) but had not improved.

Every 2 weeks, every patient filled
out a 0 to 10 symptom-severity questionnaire and a Short-Form-8, a functionality and quality-of-life
survey that had been used to evaluate patients in similar research studies over the previous 20 years.

By the 10th week, all 13 patients receiving only natural therapies had a 75%–100% improvement
in each of their symptoms.

The 14 patients in the control group had minimal improvement in only
some of their symptoms.

By the 18th week of treatment, those who had received natural remedies
had further improvement, but those in the control group did not.

The natural treatment program was
used on many other Lyme patients after the 18-week study was completed.

It was modified to make
it simpler (for better patient compliance) and more effective.

For instance, additional antimicrobial
herbals such as Banderol were added to Samento, which had been used in the initial study.

In early 2007, Richard Horowitz, MD, placed dozens of his PTLDS patients on the natural pro -
gram developed in Dallas and reported at the International Lyme and Associated Diseases (ILADS)
conference that 70% of his most ill patients had markedly improved within 6 months.

Dr. Horowitz
and others even used this program with fairly good results on Lyme patients who had never taken,
and refused to take, pharmaceutical antibiotics.

The “Microbial Defense” herbs in the natural pro -
gram appeared to have good antimicrobial effects against not only Borrelia  but also most coinfec -
tions, most fungal infections, many viruses, and even several parasites.

Based on feedback from
some of the patients who had failed Dr. Horowitz’s treatment regimens, the CSP or Cowden Support
Program (as the herbal regimen was then called by Dr. Horowitz) was modified a bit more to the
way it has been used from 2008 through 2014.59 The Borreliose Centrum (Borreliosis Center) in
Germany in 2011 did a 9-month pilot study with 20 Lyme patients, using the revised CSP.

These
patients had all been previously treated with antibiotics but were still very symptomatic.

After the
study, the researchers found that 80% of the patients had marked symptomatic improvement in many
areas, such as chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, joint pain, chest pain, headache, fever, chills, sweats,
insomnia, and anxiety.

Furthermore, 90% had improved laboratory test results ( Borrelia  IgM, IgG
by EIA and blot, polymerase chain reaction [PCR], Elispot-LTT, and CD57).

Herxheimer reactions,
or the detoxification reactions from rapid microbe die-off, occurred in 45% of the patients, but the
CSP was otherwise tolerated well.

The conclusion of all these unpublished pilot studies is that the
natural products in CSP can make a marked difference in so-called PTLDS patients.

VENOUS VASCULITIS IN LYME DISEASE
Figure 11.3 is the infrared-imaging thermography (a picture from a camera that measures heat
coming off the skin) of a woman with borreliosis and chronic headaches.

You can see a red streak
that extends up and down her neck over her jugular vein (the vein that carries blood from her brain
back down into her chest).

This image appears to represent venous vasculitis (an inflammation in
the jugular vein likely caused by microbes growing in the vein and the immune system response to
those microbes).

Thermography of patients with no borreliosis usually shows no red streaking in the
neck over the jugular vein.271 Lyme Disease and the Heart
The first description of inflammation near veins in patients with MS was in 1863.60 More
recently, Dr. Zamboni described a stenosis (narrowing) of the jugular veins in the neck (and
certain other veins that drain blood from the brain) in every patient with MS that he evaluated
but in none of his control patients without MS.61 Dr. Zamboni named this condition chronic cere -
brospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI).

When Dr. Zamboni did venous angioplasty (balloon
dilation) of the narrowed neck veins of the patients with MS, several of the patients had marked
improvement in their weakness and other MS symptoms.

However, many of those who initially
improved later worsened again and the jugular vein narrowing redeveloped.

Dietrich Klinghardt,
MD, PhD (pers.

comm.

), found that most of his MS patients had previously unrecognized Lyme
borreliosis by blood tests.

Those Lyme-positive MS patients had ultrasound testing of their neck
veins using Dr. Zamboni’s published procedures and were positive for CCSVI.

Dr. Klinghardt did
muscle testing on those Lyme-positive MS patients with CCSVI, which showed that Borrelia  and
some of the Lyme coinfections were present in high concentrations in the narrowed jugular veins
of the MS patients.

Dr. Klinghardt treated these MS patients with natural Lyme-eradicating thera -
pies until no Borrelia  or coinfections could be identified by muscle testing in their jugular veins.

When these MS patients then had vein angioplasty for the CCSVI, their neurological symptoms
markedly improved and did not recur later.

Dr. Klinghardt also noted the CCSVI condition (by
Zamboni’s ultrasound) in a variety of other patients who were Lyme positive by blood tests but
did not have MS (especially in children with autism and adult Lyme patients with neuroborreliosis
symptoms).

Recently, David Hickey, MD (pers.

comm.

), did ultrasound  imaging for CCSVI (with
Zamboni’s technique) on a group of more than 25 Lyme-positive patients and did infrared imaging
thermography on the same Lyme patients.

If the ultrasound test was positive for CCSVI, then the
thermography showed an obvious red streak over the jugular vein in almost every patient.

A few
of those Lyme patients have now been treated with sufficient herbal antimicrobial therapies (and
no venous angioplasty) so that they are no longer positive for CCSVI by Dr. Zamboni’s criteria.

)272  Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
A red streak over the jugular vein on thermography is a sign of inflammation in the jugular vein.

Doctors are taught in formal training how much the inflammation in the arteries contributes to
strokes, heart attacks, and other cardiovascular diseases, but much less is known about how inflam -
mation in the veins affects health.

This is an area where much research still needs to be done, but it
is important for the reader to be aware that Lyme disease may be playing a large, previously unrec -
ognized role in vascular diseases, especially venous diseases.

FOCUSING ON THE PHYSIOLOGY RATHER THAN THE LYME MICROBES
Too often, medical doctors are so focused on removing the microbes from the Lyme patient’s body
that they overlook the patient in whom these microbes dwell.

There are a variety of conditions that
can exist in a Lyme patient’s body that could predispose the patient to becoming ill from a Lyme
microbe or cause him or her to remain ill once infected.

Immune weakness from various causes
can make it easier for a microbial process to start and to continue.

Toxicity, nutritional deficiencies,
dehydration, hypoxia, gastrointestinal dysfunction with dysbiosis, and so on can create an environ -
ment that is more conducive to microbial growth.

Sometimes, the microbial growth adds to these
conditions.

For example, as a result of the immune system response to viruses, fungi, Borrelia , or
other microbes, thrombin (a clotting factor) is released, which, in turn, stimulates the production
of fibrin (a clot-forming substance) and impairs the breakdown of fibrin.62 The fibrin that attaches
itself to the inner lining of the smallest blood vessels (capillaries) and prevents red blood cells from
delivering sufficient oxygen into the tissues.

This causes oxygen-deficient metabolism and buildup
of lactic acid in the tissues.63 Most microbes grow well in an oxygen-deficient, acidic environ -
ment.

Human cells, however, do not function well in an acidic environment with low oxygen levels
because human metabolic enzymes cannot make enough ATP (the essential energy molecule for
the cell) under these conditions.

Low ATP in the heart muscle of a Lyme patient can thus contribute
to cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias.

In addition, many Lyme microbes
produce biotoxins that are very toxic to human tissues, especially the electrical conducting tis -
sues of the heart, and can further predispose to tissue dysfunction, heart block, cardiomyopathy,
arrhythmias, and other illness.

Therefore, comprehensive treatment for a patient with Lyme disease
should not end after picking an appropriate antimicrobial agent, but it should also address issues of
hydration, nutrition, sleep, tissue oxygenation, detoxification, gut function, excessive blood clotting,
and other health issues.

The CSP was designed with these issues in mind.

Patients on the CSP are encouraged to drink
two to three quarts, or liters, of water per day spread out through the day so that tissues will have
sufficient hydration to spontaneously detoxify.

Patients on the CSP are also given Pinella, Burbur,
and Parsley Detox tinctures to assist the detoxification of the brain, nervous tissue, liver, gall blad -
der, kidneys, and lymph vessels.

Magnesium malate capsules in the CSP are given to address one
of the most common nutritional deficiencies in chronically ill patients: magnesium deficiency.

The
Zeolite and Zeolite HP in the CSP are capsules of volcanic clay powder imprinted with energies to
help detoxify heavy metals from the body.

Sparga tincture in the CSP helps to detoxify the residuals
of pharmaceutical sulfa drugs, which if present would impair production in the body of glutathione
(a primary detoxification agent made by the body to bind and clear heavy metals and various man-
made chemicals).

Serrapeptase capsules in the CSP prevent excessive microbe-induced blood clot -
ting, strip fibrin from the blood vessel linings so that oxygen can get into the tissues more easily, and
also strip fibrin off microbes hiding in the body so that immune cells can identify and remove those
microbes.

Nutramedix Amantilla, Babuna, and Melatonin tinctures are used as needed in the CSP
to improve sleep and reduce stress.

Samento, Banderol, Cumanda, Houttuynia, Enula, and Mora are
the herb tinctures used in the CSP on a cycling basis to reduce the microbial load in patients with
Borrelia  and coinfections.

Several of these herbs are effective antifungals as well as being antibac -
terial, antiparasitic, and even antiviral.

Because they are in alcoholic tinctures, they appear to be 273 Lyme Disease and the Heart
absorbed in the stomach and upper small intestine, so it is unlikely that they damage the healthy
microbes in the gut like pharmaceutical antibiotic pills would.

Considerable evidence has accumulated that Lyme disease is quite capable of evading the patient’s
immune system, especially when treated with pharmaceutical antibiotics.64 Because B.  burgdorferi
can invade and remain alive inside the white blood cells called macrophages65 and lymphocytes66
and even suppress the numbers of natural killer lymphocytes called CD57 + NK cells,67 the immune
system is often hard hit by Borrelia  and therefore not very effective in eliminating Borrelia
from the body.

Further, chronic Lyme disease can even produce persistent  inflammation from an
autoimmune-like reaction induced by the Borrelia .68
Clinical experience is now mounting that the CSP is superior to doxycycline and other phar -
maceutical antibiotics in dealing with these various Lyme-induced immune system problems and
in treating advanced Lyme disease, especially if the symptoms have been present for more than
a few weeks when the diagnosis is made and treatment is started.

One of the best studied of the
Nutramedix Microbial Defense herbs is Samento.

It is an extract of the inner bark of Uncaria
tomentosa  (commonly called cat’s claw), which is a vine that climbs up to 100 ft into the top of
the Amazonian rain forest trees.

Samento contains pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids (POAs), which
stimulate the formation of new B and T lymphocytes (white blood cells responsible for antibody
production and cellular immunity)69; but Samento, unlike most other forms of cat’s claw on the
market, contains no tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids (TOAs).

Because TOAs block the immune stimu -
lating effect of POAs, Samento may have better immune stimulating effect than most other cat’s
claw products, which means theoretically better effects against Lyme microbes as well as against
cancers.70 Samento also contains quinovic acid glycosides, which appear to have antiviral effects,71
and Samento is anti-inflammatory,72 just to name a few of its beneficial properties.

dysbiosis : a c oMMon coMorbid  condition  in lyMe carditis  Patients
Some patients have intestinal dysbiosis (overgrowth of abnormal, disease-causing microbes in the gut)
before they ever acquire Lyme disease.73 This is most commonly caused by pharmaceutical antibiotic
use, or by consuming antibiotic-tainted meats, dairy products, or eggs.

Dysbiosis can also be caused by
psychological stress, especially when protracted; physical stress (such as injuries); other prescription
drugs and over-the-counter drugs (especially corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
like aspirin and ibuprofen); certain dietary factors (such as food preservatives, excessive dietary sugar,
and genetically modified foods); as well as other causes.

There should be nearly 1000 different species
of friendly bacteria in the healthy human intestine,74 but there are far fewer species in patients who
have been exposed to antibiotics, either intentionally for Lyme treatment or unintentionally by eating
certain antibiotic-contaminated meats, dairy, or eggs.

Most Lyme patients who have been treated with
antibiotics have dysbiosis because most antibiotics indiscriminately kill many of the friendly bacteria
in the intestine and allow the overgrowth of disease-causing fungi or antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Fungi in the gut can extend their tiny fingerlike projections (hyphae) through intestinal walls,
which creates “leaky gut.” Intestinal parasites can also burrow tiny holes in the intestinal wall.

If
incompletely digested, dietary proteins pass through these microscopic holes in the intestinal wall
and food allergies can develop.

Random food allergy reactions put additional stress on the immune
system and the cardiovascular system.

In addition, food allergy reactions can cause allergic gastro -
enteritis and/or celiac disease.75 During allergic gastroenteritis, there can be swelling of the intes -
tinal lining, which can impair the absorption of nutrients from the intestinal tract.

Some of these
nutrients, like magnesium, may be very important for heart function.

In addition, allergic gastritis
can damage parietal cells that line the stomach to the point where production and release of hydro -
chloric acid in the stomach is impaired.

There can then be insufficient hydrochloric acid to make
the protein-digesting enzyme in the stomach called pepsin, with a resultant impairment of dietary
protein breakdown into its constituent amino acids.

Also, hydrochloric acid, which is dumped by 274  Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
the stomach into the duodenum, is the primary stimulus for the body to release a hormone called
cholecystokinin (CCK).

If CCK production is deficient due to insufficient hydrochloric acid, then
the gall bladder and bile ducts will not contract properly.

This results in a deficiency of bile salts in
the intestine, which are necessary to solubilize and absorb from the intestine fat-soluble vitamins
(A, D, E, and K) and other essential fats (especially the ω-3 fats eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and
docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]).

Vitamin E is a very important antioxidant for the heart and blood
vessels, and the ω-3 fats are protective against inflammation of the heart and blood vessels caused
by excessive ω-6 fats in the diet.

The EPA, and to a lesser extent DHA, have anti-inflammatory
and antithrombotic actions in the body, which is very important in an inflammatory, excessive blood
clot-forming condition like Lyme disease, especially Lyme carditis.

In addition, deficiency of CCK
results in insufficient release of pancreatic enzymes (proteases, lipases, etc.

), which are involved in
the digestion and absorption of amino acids and other essential nutrients.

Therefore, restoring gas -
trointestinal health (and normal gut biosis) is paramount to the recovery of chronically ill patients,
especially Lyme carditis patients.

Stress reduction techniques can also aid in gastrointestinal health, immune health, and cardio -
vascular health.

When stress reduction is done before meals, gastrointestinal function improves.

These techniques are important because most chronically ill patients are under tremendous stress.

This stress often causes excessive cortisol production, which then weakens the immune system and
causes stress-induced damage of the hydrochloric acid–producing cells of the stomach.

This stress often causes excessive cortisol production, which then weakens the immune system and
causes stress-induced damage of the hydrochloric acid–producing cells of the stomach.

Therefore,
avoiding as many food allergens as possible; treating the gut dysbiosis with natural, herbal, anti -
fungal, and antiparasitic remedies; and taking probiotics and prebiotic fibers (such as psyllium,
slippery elm, or rice bran solubles) can often be quite helpful in the recovery of chronically ill
Lyme patients.

It can also be helpful to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroid
drugs, and pharmaceutical antibiotics and to take plant-derived digestive enzymes and possibly
some  ox-bile  capsules with meals, until normal gut function is restored.

Man-Made toxins: an additional  coMorbid  condition  in lyMe carditis
Toxins can impair immune function and the metabolic enzyme systems of cells, thereby mak -
ing tissues and organs too “sick” to properly function.

Toxicity in the heart definitely contributes
to cardiomyopathy and probably contributes to cardiac arrhythmias and even AV heart block as
well.

Therefore, toxins can create a host of symptoms, some of which mimic Lyme disease, or can
make Lyme disease more symptomatic, including from heart-related symptoms.

When a patient
is toxic, this predisposes the patient to becoming ill when exposed to Borrelia  and coinfections
and/or to remain ill after Lyme disease treatment.

Toxins in the heart will increase the probability
that Borrelia  and other coinfections will concentrate enough in the heart to cause Lyme carditis
symptoms.

And when Lyme microbes infect the heart and cause inflammation there, the inflam -
mation attracts more toxins, thus creating a self-sustaining cycle.

Many of the toxins found in the
body are absorbed from the enterohepatic circulation system (toxins absorbed from the intestines
travel through the hepatic portal vein, poison the liver first, and then travel to, and poison, other
vital organs thereafter).

Some of the toxins in the body are produced in the gut by microbes that
reside there.

The toxins that these microbes produce are called biotoxins.

Others are toxins that
are ingested by the patient through food, water, and other fluids.

Still others that the body harbors
are toxins taken in through the skin, from such things as lotions and cosmetics and by bathing in
unfiltered tap water, or that are breathed in through the lungs or taken in by other mucosal surfaces
of the body.

And some toxins result from patient exposure to dental restoration materials, implants,
and other dental procedures.

Regardless of the route of initial exposure to a toxin, most toxins are metabolized to varying
degrees in the liver and/or conjugated with carrier molecules and then dumped by the bile duct sys -
tem of the liver into the upper intestine.

Often, if a toxin “processed” in this manner is not passed
into the toilet with feces quickly enough, gut microbes can cleave off the carrier molecules, thereby 275 Lyme Disease and the Heart
releasing the toxins to then be reabsorbed  into the lymphatic system or the hepatic portal vein (thus
retoxifying the body).

Certain “toxin binders” can be taken by mouth to reduce the absorption (and
reabsorption) of toxins.

Some of the most common natural binders include fibers (dietary fibers,
psyllium, slippery elm, rice bran, etc.

), cracked chlorella, and clays (especially zeolite clay).

One
of the most effective pharmaceutical toxin binders is cholestyramine.76 Because healthy people
should have three bowel movements per day, most people with Lyme disease are considered to be
constipated.

If constipated people take too much fiber (especially if they are not drinking enough
water every day), the constipation can become much more severe.

In most cases, constipation can be

In most cases, constipation can be
avoided by drinking 2 oz.

(60 mL) of pure water every 15 minutes throughout the day and by taking
ascorbic acid (preferably unbuffered, non-corn-derived vitamin C) after most meals.

In most Lyme
patients, the dose of vitamin C should be gradually increased at every meal until the bowels are
loose.

The fiber can then be slowly increased in the diet so that the body will regain formed bowel
movements.

The ascorbic acid form of vitamin C taken on a full stomach at the end of a meal will
usually not irritate the stomach, especially if taken with a supplemental fiber.

Some practitioners
have also found that if vitamin C is taken perfectly simultaneously with certain herbs, pharmaceu -
ticals, and other supplements the absorption and/or tissue uptake of those herbs, pharmaceuticals,
and supplements may be impaired by the vitamin C. Therefore, herbs, pharmaceuticals, and supple -
ments should usually be taken before meals and vitamin C after those meals with fiber and/or clay
supplements.

Common problematic toxins found in chronically ill Lyme patients include the following: heavy
metals (especially mercury), pesticides, herbicides, solvents, most pharmaceuticals, and biotoxins
(especially mycotoxins).

Heavy metals can do all of the following: (1) bind to cellular enzymes in
place of mineral cofactors and block cellular enzyme actions; (2) produce oxidant or free radical
damage to tissues; or (3) bind to, and deactivate, other vital molecules in the body, such as gluta -
thione.

If heavy metals or other free radical substances (like Borrelia  biotoxins, pesticides from
foods, and chlorine from tap water) prevent cellular enzymes in the heart from producing enough
ATP energy molecules, then the muscular contractions of the heart chambers are impaired,  resulting
in a cardiomyopathy.

These are just a few mechanisms by which heavy metals create ill health.

Sometimes, the body develops an immune reaction to the heavy metals whenever heavy metals
become attached to healthy cells.

This is regardless of whether the body becomes toxic from the
metal or not.

Immune reactions occur most commonly in response to nickel, palladium, gold, mer -
cury, titanium, cadmium, and lead.

Such reactions, which occur in the heart muscle and blood vessel
linings as well as other tissues throughout the body, can be identified by blood tests through laborato -
ries such as the MELISA laboratories (www.melisa.org).

Immune reactions to metals can contribute
to autoimmunity,77 fatigue, and inflammation of the heart, blood vessels, and various other tissues
(which can mimic Lyme-induced cardiovascular disease and make Lyme disease symptoms worse).

One of the most common and most problematic heavy metal toxins in chronically ill patients
is mercury because it represents more than 50% of the composition of most dental amalgam fill -
ings and is found in most fish that people eat.

Mercury toxicity can cause hypertension, coronary
heart disease, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, reduced heart rate variability, increased
carotid intima-media thickness and carotid artery obstruction, cerebrovascular accident, general -
ized atherosclerosis, proteinuria, and dysfunction or insufficiency of the kidneys,78 as well as car -
diomyopathy and various neurological and other conditions.

As previously discussed, Lyme disease
has been reported to cause cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and many other conditions also
caused by mercury, so sometimes it is difficult to be sure whether Lyme disease or mercury or both
are contributing to a specific condition, especially because a large percentage of Lyme patients have
no history of tick bites or EM rash.

When heart muscle biopsies were analyzed for mercury content in patients with DCM compared
to patients with coronary artery disease (controls), the mercury content of the heart was 22,000
times greater in DCM than in controls.79 The first step in resolving toxicity from mercury, as with
any other toxin, is to stop, or at least reduce, the ongoing uptake of that toxin into the body.

If a 276  Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
patient has mercury-amalgam dental fillings, it may be important for him or her to cautiously have
those amalgams removed by a dentist skilled in safe amalgam removal.

The amalgams should
be replaced with nonmetallic, biocompatible materials.

Patients should also reduce their fish con -
sumption, most of which is heavily contaminated with mercury.

Instead, they should take distilled
and/or chelated fish oils as supplements to provide their bodies with essential ω-3 oils, which are
essential to the health of the heart, blood vessels, and most other tissues.

After all amalgams are
removed, gradual detoxification from mercury and other heavy metals can be done with zeolite,
chlorella, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), dimercaptopropane-sulfonate (DMPS), ethylenediami -
netetraacetic acid (EDTA), and other metal binders.

The primary sources of ongoing toxification of the body from other heavy metals must also be
identified and avoided.

All of the following heavy metals contribute, to varying degrees, to keeping
people with advanced Lyme disease chronically ill and should be avoided whenever possible: alumi -
num is the first of these.

It is found in antacids, aluminum cookware, aluminum foil, antiperspirants,
and many toothpastes (as bauxite “inert” filler).

Antimony is another toxic metal.

It is often found
in the textile industry (especially polyester clothing), some metal alloys, paints, glass and ceramics,
solder, some batteries, bearing metals, semiconductors, some antiparasitic drugs, and in bedding/
linens that are sprayed with antimony as a flame retardant.

Antimony was found to be 12,000 times
higher in concentration in heart muscle biopsies of patients with cardiomyopathy than in the heart
muscle of patients without cardiomyopathy,79 so antimony may also mimic Lyme carditis.

Arsenic,
another toxic metal, can be found in some soils (and the well water beneath those soils), fuel oils and
coal, weed killers, pesticides, fungicides, pressure-treated lumber, rice, seafood, and commercially
produced chicken.

Cadmium is another toxic metal that can be found in batteries, cigarettes (and
cigarette smoke), makeup (including lipstick, blush, foundation, and facial powders), various foods
(including shellfish, coffee, tea, soft drinks, and some fruits), soldered water pipes, coal-burning
furnaces, fungicides, pesticides, plastics, and hair-care products (including permanent solutions,
hair dyes, bleaches, and hair sprays).

Lead can be found in some hair color products, ceramic glazes,
bullets, leaded paint, water from lead-soldered copper pipes, solder in food cans, soil, leaded gaso -
line, batteries, battery factories, lead smelters, cosmetics, and pesticides.

Nickel can be found in
stainless steel cookware, dental crowns and other dental metals, surgical prostheses, trace minerals,
cigarette smoke, jewelry, industrial waste, hydrogenated fats, and fertilizers.

Radioactive metals (uranium, radium, plutonium, radioactive strontium, radioactive cesium, etc.)

are found in ever-increasing amounts in the environment, as a result of the accumulation of over
300 nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere since World War II, from nuclear power plants and
from nuclear accidents (Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima).

No one can avoid all of
these toxic heavy metals, but once a serious effort has been made to avoid as many as feasible, a
periodic detoxification can be undertaken with heavy metal binders.

No one can avoid all of
these toxic heavy metals, but once a serious effort has been made to avoid as many as feasible, a
periodic detoxification can be undertaken with heavy metal binders.

As stated before, these heavy
metals and radioactive elements can accumulate in the heart, blood vessel linings, and other tissues
of the body, causing free radical damage to tissues; impairment of metabolic enzyme function; and
symptoms that mimic Lyme disease, including Lyme cardiovascular disease.

Accumulation of pesticides and herbicides in the body can be a large impediment to resolving
chronic illnesses like Lyme disease because, like heavy metals, they create free radical damage in
human tissues; disrupt normal function of metabolic enzymes; and alter the function of the auto -
nomic nervous system, which is responsible for regulating heart rate, heart muscle contractility, and
blood vessel tone.

These and other man-made chemicals are taken into the body via skin contact
and by breathing contaminated air, but pesticides and herbicides most commonly enter the body
through the consumption of nonorganic food and drink.

Because of the bioconcentration effect,
nonorganic meats/dairy/eggs usually have several times more pesticides and herbicides than nonor -
ganic vegetables.

In a vegetarian diet, the sweetest nonorganic fruits have the most pesticides and
herbicides, followed by other nonorganic fruits, then nonorganic root vegetables, and then other
vegetables (with the least pesticides and herbicides).

Therefore, when trying to reduce the intake of
pesticides and herbicides it would be wise for people to always eat vegetarian when eating out so 277 Lyme Disease and the Heart
that they do not get the bioconcentration of food toxins in the animal-derived foods.

They should
also only eat organic meats and dairy products at home and try to make sure that most fruits (espe -
cially the sweetest ones) that they eat are organic and that the root vegetables are also organic.

One
type of bad oil that has found its way into foods is cottonseed oil.

More pesticides and herbicides
are sprayed on cotton plants than almost any other plant.

Therefore, products with cottonseed oil
should be avoided, because they are highly contaminated.

People can reduce their exposure to other
man-made chemicals by doing all of the following: (1) reading labels on all household  products,
(2)  not putting anything on the skin or into the indoor air that could not be safely  swallowed,
(3) using low  volatile organic compounds  (low VOC) wall paints, (4) using only natural cleaning
solutions in the house, (5) taking the outdoor shoes off at the door, and (6) opening several windows
for ventilation of the house and office each day for several minutes (or even a few hours during
better weather).

It appears that various toxins (pesticides, herbicides, some heavy metals, solvents,
other man-made chemicals, and possibly even biotoxins) are mobilized from the body, and associ -
ated symptoms are improved, when sitting in an infrared sauna at 110°F–160°F.80 It is beneficial to
take ginger, yarrow, or rapid-acting niacin at a dose of 100 mg (gradually building to 2000 mg) just
before the sauna.

This will cause a flushing and blood vessel dilation in the skin, which presum -
ably then carries more of the heat-mobilized toxins into the sweat glands and sebaceous glands for
excretion by the body.

A cool shower, with a thorough soap lathering, immediately after the sauna
helps to bind excreted toxins on the skin and to wash them down the drain.

Because minerals are
also lost in the sweat, people undergoing sauna should take supplemental minerals after the saunas.

Some people with Lyme disease have had mycotoxin exposure, which creates many of the same
symptoms as Lyme disease.

Mycotoxins : yet anot Her coMorbid  condition  in lyMe carditis
Some people with Lyme disease have had mycotoxin exposure, which creates many of the same
symptoms as Lyme disease.

Animal research shows that some mycotoxins can cause various
arrhythmias and even AV heart block, essentially indistinguishable from that seen with Lyme car -
ditis.81 Mycotoxins are chemicals produced by fungi that are immune disruptive, fat soluble, and
usually not easily biodegradable.

The fungal microbes that produce mycotoxins are sometimes
found in the human body, in water-damaged buildings in which people live or work, or in food or
fluids that people consume or sometimes come from a combination of all of the above.

Some Lyme
patients develop fungal overgrowth in their gut and/or sinuses after taking antibiotics and then
become more ill because of the fungus and its mycotoxins.

Other patients get mycotoxin exposure
initially from a water-damaged building and then when they get a tick bite sometime after that they
become much more ill from the Borrelia  and coinfections than they might have been otherwise, due
to the immune-damaging effects of the mycotoxins.

If patients are affected by mycotoxins when
they get infected with Lyme microbes, then Borrelia  and/or coinfections are more likely to cause
Lyme carditis and other more serious Lyme disease complications.

If mycotoxins are suspected to be affecting a patient, a reasonable quick and easy screening test
to confirm this is the visual contrast sensitivity (VCS) test found on www.survivingmold.com.

If
a patient’s vision is better than 20:50 and he or she fails the VCS test, then optic nerve toxicity is
likely and mycotoxins are one of the most common causes of this toxicity.

If a patient takes a repeat
VCS test the following day, after a good night’s sleep, and fails the test again, a reasonable next step
is for that person to look carefully in every room in their home and workplace where water could
be leaking: under every sink and toilet, around every shower and tub, behind every dishwasher,
clothes washer, ice-maker, or any place where there could be a roof leak.

If no moisture or fungal
growth can be seen, then the person should also feel with their hands for moisture or unusual cool -
ness in these areas.

If there is coolness or moisture, this could indicate that subsurface moisture is
also present.

If no moisture, mold, or fungus can be found on inspection of these locations, then
it is a good idea for that person to purchase from the plumbing department of one of the national
chain hardware stores several petri dishes of culture medium used to culture mold from the air.

One
culture plate, with the lid off, should be placed on an outside window ledge, where there is no wind 278  Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
or sunlight, for the amount of time specified on the packaging.

Other open culture plates should be
placed in each interior room (also not in the sunlight) for the same length of time with no air puri -
fiers running.

The culture plates should then be collected after the specified length of time, the lids
placed back on the culture plates, and a label placed on the bottom of each culture plate to indicate
where it had been placed: for example, outside window ledge, master bathroom, master bedroom,
kitchen, or laundry room, and so on.

All of the closed and labeled culture plates should be placed
in a single location inside the house where the temperature is comfortable and there is never any
sunlight or fluorescent lights (a fireplace mantel or top of a piano are possible choices).

The plates
should then be examined daily and the number of mold colonies counted.

If any plate has more fun -
gal colonies than the “outside” plate, then that room is the likely source of the mycotoxins that are

If any plate has more fun -
gal colonies than the “outside” plate, then that room is the likely source of the mycotoxins that are
causing at least some of the patient’s symptoms.

Environmental specialists can then be contracted
for further evaluation and/or mold remediation.

It is very risky to a patient’s health to try to remedi -
ate mold problems in their home on their own.

Because mycotoxins, as well as other toxins previ -
ously discussed, can cause arrhythmias and other cardiac conditions similar to Lyme carditis, it is
very important to evaluate cardiac disease patients for Lyme disease and for these various toxins.

CONCLUSION
Lyme disease is an underrecognized epidemic in the United States, with an estimated 300,000 new
cases per year.

Many doctors believe that Lyme disease is only found near Lyme; but in reality it is
prevalent throughout the United States, as well as in many other countries.

Lyme disease and its coin -
fections are difficult to diagnose because the blood tests are often falsely negative, but EDS and muscle
testing may be helpful data-gathering tools to assist the practitioner in making a proper diagnosis when
the blood tests fall short.

Based on considerable research, it is likely that many people with Lyme dis -
ease are being inadequately treated with pharmaceutical antibiotics, in part, because of the limiting
treatment standards published by the IDSA.

As a result, many Lyme patients and their practitioners are
resorting to natural, nonpharmaceutical treatment programs such as the CSP.

The CSP successfully
addresses Borrelia , other coinfections, as well as various comorbid conditions all at the same time.

Lyme disease can cause various cardiovascular effects such as AV heart block (and passing out),
various other arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and even vasculitis (inflamma -
tion of the blood vessels).

Because Lyme disease is known as a great imitator, the Lyme diagnosis
should be considered irrespective of what symptoms are present, including arrhythmias and other
predominantly cardiovascular symptoms.

Fortunately, most cardiovascular effects of Lyme disease
are short-lived once the diagnosis of Lyme disease is made and appropriate treatment is given.

One
underrecognized Lyme vascular disease, just recently noted on thermography, is jugular venous
vasculitis, which appears to cause CCSVI.

This is a blood vessel inflammation, presumably caused
by Borrelia  and other microbes, that results in a blood vessel narrowing, which then contributes to
neurological diseases such as MS or autism.

A common treatment mistake that many conventional doctors make with Lyme patients is to be
so focused on removing the microbes from the Lyme patient’s body that they overlook the patient
in whom those microbes dwell.

Most Lyme patients, especially Lyme carditis patients, find much
better success in recovering from illness if they address hydration, tissue oxygenation, nutrition,
detoxification, gut function and sleep quality, as well as the microbial load.

Natural therapies that
address these other issues can help improve the Lyme patient markedly in many cases even without
antibiotics, which may then resolve the cardiovascular condition caused by the Lyme.

12Metabolic Cardiology
The Missing Link in the Treatment
and Management of Heart Failure
Stephen T. Sinatra
Takeaways and key concepts:
1.

Metabolic therapy involves the administration of a substance normally found in the body
to enhance a metabolic reaction within the cell.

2.

Such a therapy may be achieved in two ways.

A substance can be given to correct a defi -
ciency of a cellular component, or a substance can be given to achieve greater than normal
levels in the body to drive an enzymatic reaction in a preferential direction.

3.

Metabolic cardiology supports biochemical reactions that improve energy substrates in
heart cells.

4.

In this chapter, four metabolic substances that support cardiac metabolism are reviewed:
a. Magnesium facilitates 300 enzymatic reactions.

b. Coenzyme Q10, a lipid-soluble antioxidant, plays a vital role in oxidative phosphorylation.

c. L-carnitine supports β-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria while removing toxic
metabolic by-products at the same time.

d. D-ribose is the energy-limiting substrate to support adenosine triphosphate (ATP) pro -
duction in the myocyte.

5.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is literally an “energy-starved” heart, and compounds that
enhance energy substrates must be given to positively impact heart function.

6.

Diastolic dysfunction (DD) occurs when ATP levels fall and is the most important precur -
sor of systolic dysfunction and, therefore, CHF.

Diastolic dysfunction (DD) occurs when ATP levels fall and is the most important precur -
sor of systolic dysfunction and, therefore, CHF.

7.

Metabolic cardiology is a unique strategy to energize diastole and perhaps will be the
standard of care for the treatment of heart failure as, in my opinion, it is the most effective
therapy in the treatment of DD.CONTENTS

It seems like yesterday that I heard from my professors in medical school that the 5-year survival
of CHF was worse than that of cancer.

Several years later, after finishing a medical residency and
a cardiovascular fellowship, I witnessed firsthand the sufferings and experienced the frustrations of
managing patients with moderate to severe CHF.

Unfortunately, that information over 40 years ago
still rings true as most physicians managing heart failure on a day-to-day basis confront the same
frustrations and difficulties in managing their patients.

Despite tremendous advances in technology, heart failure still remains the leading cause of hos -
pitalization in the United States and its prevalence continues to increase as the population ages.

The amount of human suffering associated with heart failure is enormous, and the financial burden
placed on society is staggering.

Although there has been considerable progress in the treatment
of heart failure over the past 20 years with diuretics, ACE therapies,1,2 β-receptor blockade,3,4 and
resynchronization therapy,5–7 heart failure is still associated with an annual mortality of 10% and
30%–40%8,9 of patients die within 1 year of diagnosis.

The search for more effective treatments is
one of the major challenges in clinical cardiology.

Recently, treating the heart at metabolic and cellular levels in heart failure has been acquir -
ing increasing popularity.

Recently, treating the heart at metabolic and cellular levels in heart failure has been acquir -
ing increasing popularity.

The preservation of mitochondrial function and the optimization
of energy substrates in the heart has been gaining momentum as a new form of therapy.10,11
Because the failing myocardium is “viable but dysfunctional,”10 and not irreversibly damaged,
treatment options that target the cardiomyocyte itself should be instituted as vulnerable and dys -
functional heart cells can still be rescued.12 And if we consider the evidence for cardiomyocyte
renewal in humans,13 it makes even more sense to treat the myocardium at cellular and metabolic
levels to help bolster progress in assisting the body’s intrinsic stem cell wisdom for regenerative
therapy.14
Although the genesis of heart failure includes multiple factors and many mechanisms, the essence
of heart failure as an energy-starved heart running out of fuel identifies the myocardial energetics
of the failing heart.15,16 There is a definite energy disequilibrium between the work the heart has to
perform and the available energy it has to fulfill its needs.

Thus, supporting energy substrates in heart cells will be a new cardiological approach that
focuses on the biochemistry of cellular energy as “metabolic cardiology.”17 Many physicians are
not trained to look at heart disease in terms of cellular biochemistry; therefore, the challenge in any
metabolic cardiology discussion is in taking the conversation from “bench to bedside.”17
Bioenergetics is the study of energy transformation in living organisms used in the field of bio -
chemistry to reference cellular energy.

Understanding the distinction between the concentration of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the cell and the efficiency of ATP turnover and recycling is central
to our appreciation of cellular bioenergetics.

Once an understanding of how ATP repairs and restores heart cells is realized, targeted bio -
chemical interventions to support ATP production and turnover will be strongly considered by
physicians.

Metabolic therapies that help cardiomyocytes meet their absolute need for ATP fulfill a major
clinical challenge of preserving pulsatile cardiac function while maintaining mitochondrial, cel -
lular, and tissue viability.

D-ribose, L-carnitine, and coenzyme Q10 work in synergy to help the
ischemic or hypoxic heart preserve its energy charge.

In this chapter, we shall learn that the bottom line in the treatment of any form of cardiovascular
disease, and especially in CHF, is the restoration of the heart’s supply of ATP.

Cardiac conditions
like angina, CHF, silent ischemia, and DD all cause an ATP deficit.

Metabolic cardiology is the
missing link that has been eluding us for decades and is the major solution in improving quality of
life for those struggling with CHF.

Although I struggled in my earlier career using conventional methodologies in heart failure, my
new journey into metabolic cardiology commenced in 1982 when I successfully treated a 30-year-
old female with congestive postpartum cardiomyopathy utilizing coenzyme Q10.

For the next
30 plus years, I continued to use coenzyme Q10 while adding magnesium and later L-carnitine 285 Metabolic Cardiology
to the mix.

Then, in 2004 the missing link I have been searching for suddenly materialized in a
heartbeat.

I was attending a lecture at a symposium on antiaging medicine, when another like-minded,
board-certified cardiologist started his sizzling presentation on a new nutrient, D-ribose.

Jim
Roberts, an integrative cardiologist like me, practices in Midwest, Ohio, to be specific.

Within
the first 15 minutes of his spellbinding lecture, I felt an enormous connection with him.

I was
inspired by his enthusiasm for treating people.

Then, when I least expected it, I had an extraor -
dinary epiphany—an “aha” moment.

I was
inspired by his enthusiasm for treating people.

Then, when I least expected it, I had an extraor -
dinary epiphany—an “aha” moment.

The metaphorical “lightbulb” went off in my head, as I
listened to him describe how this new nutrient was working for his patients.

Had I at last found
the final puzzle piece for my metabolic approach to heart diseases?

“Yes, this is it,” I realized
excitedly.

I had been combining traditional medical approaches to heart disease including pharmaceuti -
cal drugs, procedures, and surgeries with several targeted nutritional supplements to support and
strengthen the heart.

I’d say at least 85%–90% of my patients were improving, recovering, and
maintaining those strides on my approach.

But at the end of the day, it’s the other 10%–15% who still struggled in compromised bodies
despite being faithful to my instructions that challenged me.

I knew there must be another piece
to the treatment puzzle in those cases, many of them with chronic CHF and/or hypertensive car -
diovascular disease with significant mitral regurgitation.

The final missing link had eluded me for
decades.

It came as a flash in my mind as I sat there.

There in my seat, my mental wheels were spinning
wildly, adding Roberts’ theory of how D-ribose contributed to the core program I had been using.

I saw the heart as a busy network of vibrating cells and realized that it was all about treating the
energy in each and every cardiac cell.

The concept of metabolic cardiology is built on the premise
that supporting cellular energy is the key to unlocking the heart’s innate potential and it unfolded in
my mind as if it had always been there, just waiting for me to get it.

Adding D-ribose to my basic foundation nutrient program started turning around that subgroup
of people in my practice who needed something more, and even put new life into those who were
doing well on other core nutrients like coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, and magnesium.

As my patients
reported progress in their own words about having extraordinary symptom relief, it became clear
that we needed to spread the news.

In 2005, I wrote The Sinatra Solution: Metabolic Cardiology18
with a fitting introduction by Dr. Jim Roberts.

Later, we would coauthor a book together titled
Reverse Heart Disease Now19 and The Sinatra Solution/Metabolic Cardiology  was updated and
republished in April of 2008 and again in 2011.

The concept of metabolic cardiology is no fluke.

Over the years, I’ve heard from hundreds
of patients and physicians, even cardiovascular pediatric surgeons and electrophysiologists, who
shared enough positive experiences with me that it’s obvious that this approach in healing the heart
absolutely works.

Once I understood how D-ribose would intertwine with the other key nutrients in my plan, it
made perfect sense that this missing link could build and magnify the generation of energy within
heart cells.

Once I saw the heart muscle as “energy starved,” how to promote energy recovery
became clearer.

It’s all about supporting those energy-starved hearts and maintaining that support
on a cellular level.

D-ribose is a building block of ATP—the energy of life.

Remember, more than 30 years ago
I first started my patients, and myself, on the vitamin-like antioxidant/nutrient called coenzyme
Q10(CoQ10) or (ubiquinone).

CoQ10 is effective on almost everything cardiac: blood pressure stabi -
lization, oxygen utilization, angina, valvular problems, arrhythmias, and chronic heart failure.

One
of the first articles that caught my attention on coenzyme Q10 was an investigation in the Annals
of Thoracic Surgery  in 198220 in which Japanese researchers showed that patients come off heart–
lung bypass machines more easily postoperatively when CoQ10 was taken for the month before
needed heart surgery.

antioxidant and membrane stabilizer, it helps to prevent the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein.

I even tracked some heart transplant candidates who were able to come off the transplant list as long
as they maintained the higher CoQ10 blood levels that I monitored for them.

I learned enough about carnitines more than 20 years ago when I wrote L-Carnitine and the
Heart.

I then added them to my basic game plan, which of course always includes a solid multi -
vitamin/multimineral at its base.

The carnitines are effective in the β-oxidation of fats as well as
transporting toxic metabolites safely out of the mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cells that
generate ATP.

Eventually, I added magnesium supplementation because, like CoQ10, the nutrient does so many
things right for the heart.

An essential component for over 300 of the body’s enzymatic reactions,
magnesium helps to increase ATP turnover in the energy-starved heart.

Despite all my successes, there was still something sticking in my craw; something was amiss.

I had doubts because not everyone with angina or heart failure got better on my program.

Even
though I was able to reduce suffering and pain for most, just one clinical failure could keep me up
at night.

Like most physicians and healthcare providers, it’s that one case where all your best efforts
just aren’t good enough, or helped only a little, that gets you obsessing.

One failure means more than
nine successes.

It was the failures that kept me going; they drove me, in fact.

I kept reading, reread -
ing, and trying multiple nutraceutical supports.

So, the day I heard of D-ribose, the pivotal pentose
sugar/nutrient that forms the basic molecule generating ATP, I knew in my own mind that we were
onto something big in terms of helping more people get well.

In 2005, I coined the term metabolic cardiology, after I sent a letter to the editor to the journal
Clinical Cardiology21 commenting on the use of coenzyme Q10 for patients awaiting heart trans -
plantation.

In essence, metabolic cardiology describes the biochemical interventions we are learn -
ing to employ to directly improve energy metabolism in heart cells.

Metabolic cardiology offers the greatest hope for the largest number of patients with cardiovas -
cular disease.

My 40 plus years as a cardiologist has afforded me time and experience to add what
had been considered alternatives to the pharmaceutical and technical standard-of-care treatments
that were basic to my studies in postgraduate training of cardiology.

But this specialty that I hold so
close to my heart still has considerable limitations that need to be addressed before any explaining
or discussing how to implement metabolic cardiology into clinical practice.

Pharmaceutical drugs, bypass surgery, angioplasty, stent placements, pacemakers, and implant -
able defibrillators all have their place, and many lives would be lost without these high-tech
interventions.

Cardiologists face a daily dilemma concerning the best diagnostic procedures to rec -
ommend to their patients and then, based on those test results, which surgical and/or pharmaceutical
interventions to select.

To complicate the choice, the evaluations we order and the treatments we
select may actually create unnecessary risks for patients, risks that are out of proportion to the ben -
efits they will experience.

For example, we consider angioplasty and stent procedures on too many
patients who are asymptomatic.

Continuing technological advances, although necessary, add to the
complexity of the decision-making process.

Cardiologists have grown reliant on these sophisticated medical processes.

Cardiologists have grown reliant on these sophisticated medical processes.

But, somewhere
along the way something has gone amiss.

Recently, there has been much mistrust and skepticism
among the public toward the conventional medical model.

Starving for new information, massive
numbers of patients are consulting alternative therapy practitioners, visiting bookstores and health
food stores in record numbers, searching the Internet for advice and creating a multibillion-dollar
industry outside the mainstream medical community.

What is driving even our most conservative patients to look at other forms of therapies?

There are
many reasons for the increased popularity of alternative medicine, including patient dissatisfaction
with ineffective conventional treatments, pharmacological drug side effects, drug errors, and high
price of medications.

Many patients are now questioning the need for potentially life-threatening drugs and invasive
interventions that carry considerable side effects, complications, and even mortality.287 Metabolic Cardiology
Recent research reviews and an analysis of peer-reviewed medical journals, as well as govern -
ment health statistics, demonstrate that our trusted medical model can cause more harm than
good.

Complications from standard-of-care interventions, medical errors, and overuse of antibi -
otics are increasing at an alarming rate.

When we consider that the fourth leading cause of death
in the United States is properly prescribed medications22 in a hospital setting, something’s got
to give.

For some patients, traditional medicine and the use of prescription medication can be very help -
ful in alleviating symptoms.

For others, the side effects of strong drugs can be almost as problematic
as the initial symptoms.

In other cases, the drugs simply aren’t providing enough relief.

You feel
better but not up to par.

Natural therapies, which are virtually side effect free, can reduce our reliance on conventional
medicines.

They are being utilized, and even preferred, by more and more people.

In many cases,
alternative therapies can augment traditional medicines and provide the final measure of relief that
is lacking with drug therapy alone.

Many patients benefit greatly from blending conventional and
alternative therapies—a strategy I call “smart medicine.” But before discussing any therapeutic
interventions, we must first focus on why we become ill.
I’ve spent decades analyzing the body’s electrical potential in electrocardiograms (ECGs or
EKGs), watching its ultrasonic synchronous vibrations on echocardiograms, and studying its pulsat -
ing structure in invasive procedures like angiography of the great vessels and heart chambers.

I have
come to appreciate the complexity and perfection of the human body and also the key importance
of cellular and vibrational energy.

Every cell generates its own energy through enzymatic reactions in the mitochondria that gener -
ate ATP.

But to understand pathology and illness, we need to focus on the damage that happens to
the repair loops in each cell.

The health of the cell is negatively impacted by bodily trauma; emotional blocks; environmental
toxins; pharmaceutical drugs; trans fats; and, most recently, electromagnetics.

When the cells are
bombarded with one or more of these agents, a departure from their healthy electrical potential and
synchronous vibration occurs.

For example, both atrial fibrillation and congestive cardiomyopathy
may occur as a result of mercury toxicity, and disturbed heart rate variability may occur as result of
chaotic electromagnetic fields (EMFs).

SECRETS OF THE CELL
It is my firm belief that the reason we become ill—whether it is heart disease or any other
condition—is really more about the jeopardized integrity of the cellular membrane of each and
every cell than anything else.

Whatever the target organs, when the cell membrane is threatened
normal functioning is impaired.

Whatever the target organs, when the cell membrane is threatened
normal functioning is impaired.

Simply stated, a healthy, semipermeable cell wall (membrane)
allows nutrients in and toxins out.

To be healthy, the cell’s membrane must be able to breathe as
it ushers in the nutrients that support its metabolism and safely transports out the waste products
of those chemical reactions to be excreted.

In other words, the cellular membrane must be able
to take in oxygen, water, glucose, nutrients, hormones, and so on, and excrete waste and toxic
by-products.

When the integrity of the cell membrane is impaired, dysfunctional energetic relationships may
manifest provoking degenerative processes that eventually cause insidious and relentless inflamma -
tion, a cycle that, if unchecked, continuously damages the cell.

In heart cells, decreased ATP concentrations in mitochondria may reflect defects in cellular
metabolism.23 In one small study investigating the relationship between left ventricular chamber
dynamics and the pathophysiology of ventricular dysfunction, biochemical events are more relevant
in cellular energy production.23 The free energy of hydrolysis of ATP—or the amount of chemical
energy available to fuel cellular function—is vitally important.24,25 We shall soon see that in heart
disease the bioenergetic property of cardiac cells is impaired because of the faulty metabolism of 288 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
ATP, especially in situations of coronary ischemia.

To maintain the heart’s pulsatory and vibratory
energy levels, supporting the mitochondrial production of ATP is critical.

Every cell has the same basic structures, in addition to being specialized.

Unlike well-armored
nuclear DNA (the genetic material in the nucleus of the cell), mitochondrial DNA have no defense
mechanisms.

The mitochondria generate the chemical energy (ATP) that is transferred to mechani -
cal energy.

In the heart muscle cell, this means managing cellular respiration, calcium and sodium
pumps, contracting and relaxing, conducting impulses, and so on.

In the process of mitochondrial respiration and the genesis of ATP, not all the oxygen is con -
verted to carbon dioxide and water.

About 3%–5% of the oxygen generated results in breakdown
products known as free radicals.

Because mitochondrial DNA has no defense mechanisms, it
is vulnerable to these unstable, unpaired electrons typical of free radical oxidative stress.

So,
it is absolutely essential to repair and support vulnerable mitochondrial activity from the relent -
less free radical stress of mitochondrial respiration that can negatively impact tissue and organ
function.

In cardiology, solving the heart’s energy crisis is essential to optimizing cardiovascular func -
tion.

For decades, heart disease prevention has inappropriately and inadvertently been focused
on lowering lipids (cholesterol) in an effort to prevent or slow down coronary artery disease.

Rather, it behooves us to shift the focus to mitochondria and employ nutritional strategies target -
ing improved ATP synthesis and, therefore, heart function.

Metabolic cardiology, a form of meta -
bolic medicine, highlights the importance of sustaining key enzymatic and biochemical reactions
in a preferential direction to revitalize the life of the cells in the heart and body.

It is now widely
accepted that one characteristic of the failing heart is persistent and progressive loss of energy.

The requirement for energy to support the systolic and diastolic work of the heart is absolute.

Therefore, a disruption in cardiac energy metabolism, and the energy supply/demand mismatch
that results, can be identified as the pivotal factor contributing to the inability of failing hearts
to meet the hemodynamic requirements of the body.

In her landmark book, ATP and the Heart ,
Joanne Ingwall, PhD,26 describes the metabolic process associated with the progression of CHF
and identifies the mechanisms that lead to a persistent loss of cardiac energy reserves as the dis -
ease process unfolds.

The heart contains approximately 700 mg of ATP, enough to fuel about 10 heartbeats.

At a
rate of 60 beats per minute, the heart will beat 86,400 times in the average day, forcing the heart
to produce and consume an amazing 6,000 g of ATP daily and causing it to recycle its ATP
pool 10,000 times every day.

This process of energy recycling occurs primarily in the mito -
chondria of the myocyte.

These organelles produce more than 90% of the energy consumed in
the healthy heart.

In the heart cell, 3,500–5,000 mitochondria fill about 35% of the cell volume.

Disruption in mitochondrial function significantly restricts the energy-producing processes of
the heart, causing a clinically relevant impact on heart function that translates to peripheral
tissue involvement.

The heart consumes more energy per gram than any other organ, and the chemical energy
that fuels the heart comes primarily from ATP (Figure 12.1).

The chemical energy held in ATP
is  resident in the phosphoryl bonds, with the greatest amount of energy residing in the outermost
bond holding the ultimate phosphoryl group to the penultimate group.

When energy is required
to provide the chemical driving force to a cell, this ultimate phosphoryl bond is broken and
chemical energy is released.

The cell then converts this chemical energy to mechanical energy
to do work.

In the case of the heart, this energy is used to sustain stretching and contracting, drive ion pump
function, synthesize large and small molecules, and perform other necessary activities of the cell.

The consumption of ATP in the enzymatic reactions that release cellular energy yields the meta -
bolic by-products adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) (Figure 12.2).

A vari -
ety of metabolic mechanisms have evolved within the cell to provide rapid rephosphorylation of
ADP to restore ATP levels and maintain the cellular energy pool.

But, these metabolic mechanisms 289 Metabolic Cardiology
are disrupted in CHF, tipping the balance in a manner that creates a chronic energy supply/demand
mismatch that results in an energy deficit.

The normal nonischemic heart is capable of maintaining a stable ATP concentration despite
large fluctuations in workload and energy demand.

In a normal heart, the rate of cellular ATP syn -
thesis via rephosphorylation of ADP closely matches ATP utilization.

The primary site of cellular
ATP rephosphorylation is the mitochondria, where fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolic products
flush down the oxidative phosphorylation pathways.

ATP recycling can also occur in the cytosol via
the glycolytic pathway of glucose metabolism, but in normal hearts this pathway accounts for only
about 10% of ATP turnover.

ATP levels are also maintained through the action of creatine kinase in a reaction that trans -
fers a high-energy phosphate creatine phosphate (PCr) to ADP to yield ATP and free creatine.

Because the creatine kinase reaction is approximately 10-fold faster than ATP synthesis via
oxidative phosphorylation, creatine phosphate acts as a buffer to ensure consistent availability of
ATP in times of acute high metabolic demand.

Although there is approximately twice as much
creatine phosphate in the cell as ATP, there is still only enough to supply energy to drive about
10 heartbeats, making the maintenance of high levels of ATP availability critical to cardiac
function.

The content of ATP in heart cells progressively falls in CHF, frequently reaching and then stabi -
lizing at levels that are 25%–30% lower than normal.27 The fact that ATP falls in the failing heart
means that the metabolic network responsible for maintaining the balance between energy supply
and demand is no longer functioning normally in these hearts.

It is well established that oxygen
deprivation in ischemic hearts contributes to the depletion of myocardial energy pools, but the loss
of energy substrates in the failing heart is a unique example of chronic metabolic failure in the
well-oxygenated myocardium.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is composed of D-ribose, adenine, and
three phosphate groups.

Breaking the chemical bond attaching the last phosphate group to ATP releases the
chemical energy that is converted to mechanical energy to perform cellular work.

ADP+Pi −Pi
FIGURE 12.2  When ATP is used, the remaining by-products are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inor -
ganic phosphate (Pi).

ADP and Pi can then recombine to form ATP in the cellular processes of energy recy -
cling.

When oxygen and food (fuel) are available, energy recycling occurs unimpeded millions of times per
second in every cell in the body.

Lack of oxygen or mitochondrial dysfunction severely limits the cell’s ability
to recycle its energy supply.290 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
The mechanism explaining energy depletion in heart failure is the loss of energy substrates
and the delay in their resynthesis.

In conditions where energy demand outstrips supply, ATP is
consumed at a rate faster than it can be restored via oxidative phosphorylation or the alternative
pathways of ADP rephosphorylation.

The cell has a continuing need for energy; so it will use all
its ATP stores and then break down the by-product, ADP, to pull the remaining energy out of this
compound as well.

What’s left is adenosine monophosphate (AMP).

Because a growing concentration of AMP is incompatible with sustained cellular function, it’s
quickly broken apart and the by-products are washed out of the cell.

The net result of this process
is a depletion of the cellular pool of energy substrates.

When the by-products of AMP catabolism
are washed out of the cell, they are lost forever (Figure 12.3).

It takes a long time to replace these
lost energy substrates even if the cell is fully perfused with oxygen again.

This reduction in energy
is like a depleted car battery struggling to start your engine.

In diseased hearts, the energy pool
depletion via this mechanism can be significant, reaching levels that exceed 40% in ischemic heart
disease and 30% in heart failure.

Under high-workload conditions, even normal hearts display a minimal loss of energy substrates.

These substrates must be restored via the de novo pathway of ATP synthesis.

This pathway is slow
and energy costly, requiring the consumption of six high-energy phosphates to yield one newly
synthesized ATP molecule.

The slow speed and high energy cost of de novo synthesis highlights the
importance of cellular mechanisms designed to preserve energy pools.

In normal hearts, the salvage
pathways are the predominant means by which the ATP pool is maintained.

Whereas de novo synthesis of ATP proceeds at a rate of approximately 0.02 nM/min/g in the
heart, the salvage pathways operate at a 10-fold higher rate.28 The function of both the de novo
and salvage pathways of ATP synthesis is limited by the cellular availability of 5-  phosphoribosy
l-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) (Figure 12.4).

PRPP initiates these synthetic reactions and is the sole
compound capable of donating the D-ribose-5-phosphate moiety required to re-form ATP and

PRPP initiates these synthetic reactions and is the sole
compound capable of donating the D-ribose-5-phosphate moiety required to re-form ATP and
preserve the energy pool.

In muscle tissue, including that of the heart, formation of PRPP is slow
and rate limited, impacting the rate of ATP restoration via the de novo and salvage pathways.

FIGURE 12.3  When the cellular concentration of ATP falls and ADP levels increase, two molecules of ADP
can combine.

This reaction provides one ATP, giving the cell additional energy, and one adenosine monophos -
phate (AMP).

The enzyme adenylate kinase (also called myokinase) catalyzes this reaction.

The AMP formed
in this reaction is then degraded, and the by-products are washed out of the cell.

The loss of these purines
decreases the cellular energy pool and is a metabolic disaster to the cell.291 Metabolic Cardiology
ENERGY STARVATION IN THE FAILING HEART
The chronic mechanism explaining the loss of ATP in CHF is decreased capacity for ATP synthesis
relative to ATP demand.

In part, the disparity between energy supply and demand in hypertrophied
and failing hearts is associated with a shift in relative contribution of fatty acid versus glucose oxi -
dation to ATP synthesis.

The major consequence of the complex readjustment toward carbohydrate
metabolism is that the total capacity for ATP synthesis decreases.

At the same time, the demand
for ATP continually increases as hearts work harder to circulate blood in the face of the increased
filling pressures that are associated with CHF and hypertrophy.

The net result of this energy supply/demand mismatch is a decrease in the absolute concentration
of ATP in the failing heart, and this decrease in absolute ATP level is reflected in a lower energy
reserve in the failing and hypertrophied heart.

A declining energy reserve is directly related to
heart function, with diastolic function being the first to be affected, followed by systolic function,
and finally global performance (Figure 12.5).

In ischemic or hypoxic hearts, the cell’s ability to
match ATP supply and demand is disrupted leading to both depletion of the cardiac energy pool and
dysfunction in mitochondrial ATP turnover mechanisms.

When ATP levels drop, diastolic heart
function deteriorates.

DD is an early sign of myocardial failure despite the presence of normal systolic function and
preserved ejection fraction.

Higher concentrations of ATP are required to activate calcium pumps
necessary to facilitate cardiac relaxation and promote diastolic filling.

This observation leads to the
conclusion that, in absolute terms, more ATP is needed to fill the heart than to empty it, consistent
with Starling’s law that requires more energy in diastole than in systole.

The absolute requirement
for ATP in the context of cardiac conditions in which energy is depleted makes a metabolic thera -
peutic approach such a reasonable intervention.

Laplace’s law confirms that pressure overload increases energy consumption in the face of abnor -
malities in energy supply.

In failing hearts, these energetic changes become more profound as left
ventricle remodeling proceeds,29–31 but they are also evident in the early development of the dis -
ease.32 It has additionally been found that similar adaptations occur in the atrium, with energetic
abnormalities constituting a component of the substrate for atrial fibrillation in CHF.33 Atrial fibrilla -
tion following coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS) has also been identified as a sequelae of DD.34
Left ventricular hypertrophy is initially an adaptive response to chronic pressure overload, but
it is ultimately associated with a 10-fold greater likelihood of subsequent chronic CHF.

FIGURE 12.4  Replacing lost energy substrates through the de novo pathway of energy synthesis begins with
D-ribose.

D-ribose can also “salvage” AMP degradation products, capturing them before they can be washed
out of the cell.

Both the de novo and salvage pathways of energy synthesis are rate limited by the availability
of D-ribose in the cell.292 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Oxidative phosphorylation is directly related to oxygen consumption, which is not decreased
in patients with pressure overload left ventricular hypertrophy.

Metabolic energy defects, instead,
relate to the absolute size of the energy pool and the kinetics of ATP turnover through oxidative
phosphorylation and creatine kinase.

Dysfunctional ATP kinetics is similar in both systolic and
diastolic heart failure and may be both an initiating event and a consequence.

Inadequate ATP availability would be expected to initiate and accentuate the adverse conse -
quences of abnormalities in energy-dependent pathways.

Factors that increase energy demand, such
as adrenergic stimulation and systolic overload, exaggerate the energetic deficit.

Consequently, the
hypertrophied heart is more metabolically susceptible to stressors such as increased chronotropic
and inotropic demand, and ischemia.

In humans, this metabolic deficit is shown to be greater in compensated left ventricular hyper -
trophy (with or without concomitant CHF) than in dilated cardiomyopathy.35,36 Hypertensive heart
disease alone was not shown to contribute to alterations in high-energy phosphate metabolism, but
it can contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy and DD that can later alter cardiac energetics.37,38
Further, for a similar clinical degree of heart failure, volume overload hypertrophy does not, but
pressure overload does, induce significant high-energy phosphate impairment.38,40 This explains
why hypertensive patients or patients with aortic valvular disease are so much more vulnerable in
the setting of even mild CHF.

Type 2 diabetes has also been shown to contribute to altering myocardial energy metabolism
early in the onset of diabetes, and these alterations in cardiac energetics may contribute to left ven -
tricular functional changes.41 The effect of age on progression of energetic altering has also been
reviewed, with results of both human42 and animal43 studies suggesting that increasing age plays a
moderate role in the progressive changes in cardiac energy metabolism that correlates to DD, left
ventricular mass, and ejection fraction.

Cardiac energetics also provides important prognostic information in patients with heart failure,
and determining the myocardial contractile reserve has been suggested as a method of differentiat -
ing which patients seeking to reverse left ventricular remodeling44 would most likely respond to
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

Patients with a positive contractile reserve are more likely
to respond to CRT and reverse remodeling of the left ventricle.

Nonresponders show a negative
contractile reserve, suggesting increased abnormality in cardiac energetics.As [ATP] falls, one by one , cellular functional

Cellular energy levels can be measured as the free energy of hydrolysis of
adenosine triphosphate, or the amount of chemical energy available to fuel cellular function.

Healthy, normal hearts
contain enough energy to fuel all the cellular functions with a contractile reserve for use in emergency.

Cellular
mechanisms used in calcium management and cardiac relaxation require the highest level of available energy.

Sodium/potassium pumps needed to maintain ion balance are also significant energy consumers.

The cellular
mechanisms associated with contraction require the least amount of cellular energy.

Taken together, results of clinical and laboratory studies confirm that energy metabolism in CHF
and left ventricular hypertrophy is of vital clinical importance.

Impaired diastolic filling and stroke
volume limit the delivery of oxygen-rich blood to the periphery.

This chronic oxygen deprivation
forces peripheral muscles to adjust and downregulate energy turnover mechanisms, a contributing
cause of symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and muscle discomfort associated with CHF.

Treatment options that include a metabolic intervention with therapies shown to preserve energy
substrates or accelerate ATP turnover are indicated for at-risk populations or patients at any stage
of disease.

D-ribose, coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, and magnesium provide critical energy support
to the compromised heart.

ENERGY NUTRIENTS FOR CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
d-ribose  (ribose)
The effect of the pentose monosaccharide D-ribose on cardiac energy metabolism has been studied
since the 1970s, with clinical studies describing its value as an adjunctive therapy in ischemic heart
disease first appearing in 1991.

Ribose is a naturally occurring simple carbohydrate that is found in
every living tissue, and natural synthesis is via the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway of glucose
metabolism.

But the poor expression of gatekeeper enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase limits its natural production in heart and muscle tissue.

The
primary metabolic fate of ribose is the formation of PRPP required for purine synthesis and salvage
via the purine nucleotide pathway.

PRPP is rate limiting in purine synthesis and salvage, and con -
centration in tissue defines the rate of flux down this pathway.

In this way, ribose is rate limiting for
preservation of the cellular adenine nucleotide pool.

As a pentose, ribose is not used by cells as a primary energy fuel.

Unlike glucose, ribose is pre -
served for the important metabolic task of stimulating purine nucleotide synthesis and salvage for the
production of ATP.

Approximately 98% of consumed ribose is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream
and is circulated to remote tissue with no first pass effect by the liver.

As ribose passes through the
cell membrane, it is phosphorylated by membrane-bound ribokinase before entering the pentose
phosphate pathway downstream of the gatekeeper enzymes.

In this way, administered ribose is able
to increase intracellular PRPP concentration and initiate purine nucleotide synthesis and salvage.

The study of ribose in CHF was first reported in the European Journal of Heart Failure  in
2003.45 Until that time, the clinical benefit for ribose in cardiovascular disease was largely confined
to its increasing role in treating coronary artery disease and other ischemic heart diseases, where
its benefit has been well established.

The reported double blind, placebo-controlled crossover study
included patients with chronic coronary artery disease and New York Heart Association (NYHA)
class II/III CHF.

Patients underwent two treatment periods of 3 weeks each, during which either oral
ribose (5 g t.i.d.)

Patients underwent two treatment periods of 3 weeks each, during which either oral
ribose (5 g t.i.d.)

or placebo (glucose, 5 g t.i.d.)

was administered.

Following a 1-week washout period,
the alternate test supplement was administered for a subsequent 3-week test period.

Before and after
each 3-week trial period, assessment of myocardial function was made by echocardiography and
the patient’s exercise capacity was determined using a stationary exercise cycle.

Participants also
completed a quality of life questionnaire.

Ribose administration significantly enhanced all indices
of diastolic heart function and exercise tolerance and was also associated with improved quality of
life score.

By comparison, none of these parameters were changed with glucose (placebo) treatment.

In addition to impaired pump function, CHF patients exhibited compromised ventilation and
oxygen uptake efficiency that presents as dyspnea.

Ventilation efficiency slope and oxygen uptake
efficiency slope are highly sensitive predictors of CHF patient survival that can be measured using
submaximal exercise protocols, which include pulmonary assessment of oxygen and carbon dioxide
levels.

In one study, ribose administration (5 g, t.i.d.)

to NYHA class III/IV CHF patients signifi -
cantly improved ventilation efficiency, oxygen uptake efficiency, and stroke volume, as measured
by oxygen pulse.46294 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
A second study47 showed that in NYHA class II/III CHF patients ribose administration signifi -
cantly maintained VO2max compared to placebo and improved ventilatory efficiency to the respi -
ratory compensation point.

A third,48 similar, study involving patients with NYHA class III CHF
investigated the effect of ribose on Doppler Tei Myocardial Performance Index (MPI), VO2max,
and ventilatory efficiency, all powerful predictors of heart failure survival in a class III heart failure
population.

Results showed that ribose improved MPI and ventilatory efficiency while preserving
VO2max.

Results of these studies show that ribose stimulates energy metabolism along the cardio -
pulmonary axis, thereby improving gas exchange.

Increased cardiac load produces unfavorable energetics that depletes myocardial energy
reserves.

Because ribose is the rate limiting precursor for adenine nucleotide metabolism, its role
in  preserving energy substrates in remote myocardium following infarction was studied in a rat
model.49 In this study, male Lewis rats received continuous venous infusion of ribose or placebo
via an osmotic minipump for 14 days.

About 1 to 2 days after pump placement, animals underwent
ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery to produce an anterior wall myocardial
infarction.

Echocardiographic analysis performed preoperatively and at 2 and 4 weeks following
infarction was used to assess functional changes as evidenced by ejection indices, chamber dimen -
sions, and wall thickness.

By all three measured indices, ribose administration better maintained the myocardium.

Contractility and wall thickness were increased, whereas less ventricular dilation occurred.

This
study showed that the remote myocardium exhibits a significant decrease in function within 4 weeks
following myocardial infarction and that, to a significant degree, ribose administration attenuates
this dysfunction.

This is an important clinical concept as I’ve seen many patients experience typical and atypical
chest symptoms as well as generalized weakness following stent and angioplasty procedures.

When
temporary ischemia occurs in the myocardium, following balloon inflation, ATP levels drop.

It may
take the body several days to make up the deficit with de novo ATP synthesis15,26.

In my experience,
ribose is a significant factor in supporting energy substrate levels that enhance ATP production, thus

In my experience,
ribose is a significant factor in supporting energy substrate levels that enhance ATP production, thus
alleviating symptoms in these patients.

Temporary or prolonged ischemia results in lower myocar -
dial energy levels.

Increasing the cardiac energy level not only improves symptoms and function
but also may delay vulnerable changes in a variety of CHF conditions.

This therapeutic advantage
ribose provides in improving cardiac index and left ventricular function suggests its value as an
adjunct to traditional therapy for ischemia and CHF.

Because D-ribose administration creates favorable physiological parameters on cardiac func -
tion and has been shown to enhance the recovery of high-energy phosphates following myocardial
ischemia, it was hypothesized that D-ribose could improve cardiological indices for off-pump coro -
nary artery bypass procedures.50 In a retrospective analysis of 366 patients undergoing off-pump
CABS, 308 received D-ribose as a perioperative metabolic protocol.

D-ribose patients had a greater
improvement in cardiac index post revascularization compared with non-D-ribose patients (37%
vs. 17%, p < .0001).50 The research has suggested that a larger randomized placebo-controlled pro -
spective trial be considered to further test the hypothesis that ribose should be considered standard
management in myocardial ischemia.

Researchers and practitioners using ribose in cardiology practice recommend a dose range of
10–15 g/day as metabolic support for CHF or other heart diseases.

In my practice, patients are
placed on a regimen of 5 g/dose three times a day for any form of CHF and/or myocardial ischemia.

Individual doses greater than 10 g are not recommended because high single doses of a hygroscopic
carbohydrate may cause mild gastrointestinal discomfort or transient lightheadedness.

As ribose
has a lower glycemic index, it should be administered with meals or mixed in beverages containing
a secondary carbohydrate source when administered to diabetic patients prone to hypoglycemia.

I also frequently recommend ribose in fruit juices to these patients or in diabetic patients taking
insulin.295 Metabolic Cardiology
COENZYME Q10 AND THE HEART
Coenzyme Q10 or ubiquinone, so named for its ubiquitous nature in cells, is a fat-soluble compound
that functions as an antioxidant and coenzyme in the energy-producing pathways.

As an antioxi -
dant, the reduced form of CoQ10 inhibits lipid peroxidation in both cell membranes and serum low
density lipoprotein and also protects proteins and DNA from oxidative damage.

Coenzyme Q10 also
has membrane-stabilizing activity.

However, its bioenergetic activity and electron transport func -
tion for its role in oxidative phosphorylation is probably its most important function.

The electron transport chain is a series of oxidation–reduction (REDOX) chemical reactions that
allow the mitochondria to transform the food you eat into energy (ATP).

The electrons need CoQ10
to make their way down the electron transport chain or ATP production slows, causing a decrease
in energy production, an increase in free radicals, and potentially disease or even death.

In CHF, oxidative phosphorylation slows due to a loss of mitochondrial protein and lack of
expression of key enzymes involved in the cycle.

Disruption of mitochondrial activity may lead
to a loss of coenzyme Q10 that can further depress oxidative phosphorylation.

In patients taking
statin-like drugs, the mitochondrial loss of coenzyme Q10 may be exacerbated by restricted coen -
zyme Q10 synthesis resulting from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reduc -
tase inhibition (Figure 12.6).

One study on this association was reported by Japanese researchers
in the 2008 International Heart Journal .51 In essence, long-term treatment with atorvastatin may
increase plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in coronary artery disease when associ -
ated with a greater reduction in plasma coenzyme Q10.

Although statins and other pharmaceutical
drugs appear to be the most significant source of CoQ10 deficiency in the general population, other
sources of coenzyme Q10 decline appear in tissues that are highly metabolically active, such as
those of the heart, immune system, inflamed gingival, and overactive thyroid gland.

As we age,
the levels of CoQ10 in our body decrease.52 This may be due to decreased endogenous production,
an insufficiency in the diet, or the cumulative effects of stress and free radicals.

Although there
is no evidence that healthy individuals need to supplement with CoQ10, tissues will benefit from
coenzyme Q10 support during times of metabolic stress.

Although coenzyme Q10 is found in relatively high concentrations in the liver, kidney, and lung,
the heart requires the highest levels of ATP activity because it is continually aerobic and contains
more mitochondria per gram than any other tissue in the body.

Cardiomyocytes, for example, contain
more than 3500 mitochondria per cell compared to a biceps muscle cell that houses approximately
200 mitochondria per cell.

Tissue deficiencies and low serum blood levels of coenzyme Q10 have
been reported across a wide range of cardiovascular diseases, including DD, CHF, hypertension,

aortic valvular disease, and coronary artery disease, and research suggests that coenzyme Q10 sup -
port may be indicated in these disease conditions.53,54
Although the medical literature generally supports the use of coenzyme Q10 in CHF, the evaluated
dose–response relationships for this nutrient have been confined to a narrow dose range, with the major -
ity of clinical studies having been conducted on subjects who were taking only 90–300 mg daily.

At
such doses, some patients have responded, whereas others have not.

In more than two dozen controlled
trials of supplemental CoQ10 in CHF, only three investigations,55–57 which failed to show improvement
in any significant cardiovascular function, had major limitations.

In the well-known study conducted by Permanetter et al.,55 a 100-mg dose of coenzyme Q10
failed to show improvement.

However, actual blood levels of CoQ10 were not obtained in this inves -
tigation; thus, it is impossible to know if a therapeutic blood level was ever achieved.

In the second
trial by Watson et al.,56 a mean treatment plasma CoQ10 level of 1.7 μg/mL was obtained with only
2 of the 30 patients having a plasma level greater than 2.0 μg/mL.

The third study performed by Khatta and colleagues57 demonstrated a mean treatment plasma
CoQ10 level of 2.2 ± 1.1 μg/mL and indicated that approximately half the patients had treatment
levels as low as 1.0 μg/mL.

Unfortunately, these last two clinical trials are frequently quoted as
CoQ10 failures despite the fact that a biosensitive result was not achieved.

Unfortunately, these last two clinical trials are frequently quoted as
CoQ10 failures despite the fact that a biosensitive result was not achieved.

In patients with CHF or dilated cardiomyopathy, I generally use higher doses of coenzyme Q10
in ranges of at least 300 mg or more to get a biosensitive result requiring a blood level at least greater
than 2.5 μg/mL and preferably 3.5 μg/mL.58 In a previous analysis in three patients with refractory
CHF, higher doses of CoQ10 were required to get such a biosensitive or therapeutic result.59
In an investigation at the Lancisi Heart Institute in Italy, researchers studied 23 patients with a
mean age of 59 years, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and crossover design.

Patients were
assigned to receive 100 mg of oral CoQ10 three times a day plus supervised exercise training.

The
study concluded that CoQ10 supplementation improved functional capacity, endothelial function,
and left ventricular contractility in CHF without any side effects.60
In a previous long-term study of 424 patients with systolic dysfunction and/or DD in the presence
of CHF, dilated cardiomyopathy, or hypertensive heart disease, a dose of 240 mg/day maintained
blood levels of coenzyme Q10 above 2.0 μg/mL and allowed 43% of the participants to discontinue
one to three conventional drugs over the course of the study.61 Patients were followed for an aver -
age of 17.8 months, and during that time a mild case of nausea was the only reported side effect.

This long-term study clearly shows coenzyme Q10 to be a safe and effective adjunctive treatment
for patients with systolic and/or diastolic left ventricular dysfunction with or without CHF, dilated
cardiomyopathy, and hypertensive heart disease.

These results are further confirmed by an investigation involving 109 patients with hypertensive
heart disease and isolated DD showing that coenzyme Q10 supplementation resulted in clinical
improvement, lowered elevated blood pressure, enhanced diastolic cardiac function, and decreased
myocardial thickness in 53% of study patients.62 A study on the longevity merits of CoQ10 in heart
failure was published in a fall 2008 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology .63
New Zealand researchers studied the relationship of plasma CoQ10 levels and survival in patients
with chronic heart failure.

In their cohort of 236 patients (mean age 77 years), they concluded that
plasma CoQ10 concentrations was an independent predictor of mortality.

The higher blood levels
were the best predictors for survival.

Researchers suggested that lower concentrations of plasma
CoQ10 might be detrimental in the long-term prognosis of CHF.

Because CoQ10 depletion is asso -
ciated with worse outcomes in CHF, they suggest further controlled intervention studies on CoQ10
supplementation.

This effect of coenzyme Q10 administration on 32 heart transplant candidates with end-stage
CHF and cardiomyopathy was actually reported 4 years64 earlier in 2004.

The study was designed
to determine if coenzyme Q10 could improve the pharmacological bridge to transplantation, and
the results showed three significant findings.

First, following 6 weeks of coenzyme Q10 therapy the
study group showed elevated blood levels from an average of 0.22 mg/L to 0.83 mg/L, an increase 297 Metabolic Cardiology
of 277% (please note that different laboratories in other countries have different standardizations
of CoQ10).

By contrast, the placebo group measured 0.18 mg/L at the onset of the study and 0.178
mg/L at 6 weeks.

Second, the study group showed significant improvement in 6-minute walk test
distance, shortness of breath, NYHA functional classification, fatigue, and episodes of waking for
nocturnal urination.

No such changes were found in the placebo group.

These results strongly show
that coenzyme Q10 therapy may augment pharmaceutical treatment of patients with end-stage CHF
and cardiomyopathy.

No such changes were found in the placebo group.

These results strongly show
that coenzyme Q10 therapy may augment pharmaceutical treatment of patients with end-stage CHF
and cardiomyopathy.

Very recently, three coenzyme Q10 studies were published, suggesting even more evidence for
its consideration in left ventricular dysfunction.

In one small study of 28 patients with ischemic
left ventricular systolic dysfunction, taking 300 mg of coenzyme Q10 supplement per day versus
28 placebo controls, 8 weeks of supplementation improved mitochondrial functioning and brachial
flow-mediated dilatation (FMD).65 The researchers concluded that coQ10 improved endothelial
function via reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with diminished ejection fraction.

In another study (Q-Symbio)66 presented in Lisbon, Portugal (2013), investigators studied 420
patients and reported not only a reduction in hospital admissions in the CoQ10 group but also a
significant decrease in mortality with 18 patients in the CoQ10 group versus 36 placebo.

The inves -
tigators concluded that CoQ10 should strongly be considered as part of the maintenance treatment
of CHF.

Finally, in another double-blind, placebo-controlled trial67 among elderly Swedish citizens,
443 patients aged 70–88 years, selenium and coQ10 were administered versus placebo.

There was
a significant reduction in mortality in the active group, 5.9% versus 12.6 controls.

In addition,
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro-BNP) and echocardiographic measurements
were significantly improved.

To summarize, CoQ10 is one of the body’s most important endogenous compounds as a powerful
antioxidant and membrane stabilizer as well as a critical electron donor for mitochondrial cellular
production.

Multiple controlled studies have confirmed my observation in three decades of CoQ10
applications in thousands of patients.

It is the most efficacious, bioenergetic, and therapeutic com -
pound I’ve ever discovered in the treatment and management of CHF.

LEVOCARNITINE (L-CARNITINE OR CARNITINE)
Carnitine is derived naturally in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine.

Biosynthesis
occurs in a series of metabolic reactions involving these amino acids, complemented with niacin,
vitamin B6, vitamin C, and iron.

Although carnitine deficiency is rare in a healthy, well-  nourished
population consuming adequate protein, CHF, left ventricular hypertrophy, and other cardiac
conditions causing renal insufficiency can lead to cellular depletion and conditions of carnitine
deficiency.

The principal role of carnitine is to facilitate the transport of fatty acids across the inner mito -
chondrial membrane to initiate β-oxidation.

The inner mitochondrial membrane is normally
impermeable to activated coenzyme A (CoA) esters.

To affect transfer of the extracellular meta -
bolic by-product acyl-CoA across the cellular membrane, the mitochondria deliver its acyl unit to
the carnitine residing in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Carnitine (as acetyl-carnitine) then
transports the metabolic fragment across the membrane and delivers it to coenzyme A residing
inside the mitochondria.

This process of acetyl transfer is known as carnitine shuttle, and the
shuttle also works in reverse to remove excess acetyl units from the inner mitochondria for dis -
posal.

Excess acetyl units that accumulate inside the mitochondria disturb the metabolic burning
of fatty acids.

Nature created carnitine to serve as a freight train or ferryboat to carry fatty acids into the mito -
chondria.

More importantly, it’s not only the burning of fat in the mitochondria that fuels the energy
for ATP, but as a high-energy organism, we humans produce a lot of toxic waste products.

This is

This is
where the carnitines are so absolutely phenomenal and instrumental, especially in cardiac health.

298 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Not only do these carnitines shuttle in the fatty acids to be burned in the mitochondria as fuel but
they also shuttle out the toxic metabolites as well.

Other crucial functions of intracellular carnitine include the metabolism of branched-chain
amino acids, ammonia detoxification, and lactic acid clearance from tissue.

Carnitine also exhibits
antioxidant and free radical scavenger properties.

Although the role of carnitine in the utilization of fatty acids and glucose in cardiac metabolism
has been known for decades, the relationship between carnitine availability in heart tissue, carnitine
metabolism in the heart, and carnitine’s impact on left ventricular function has been elucidated only
recently.

Two independent studies have investigated the relationship between tissue carnitine levels
and heart function and whether plasma or urinary carnitine levels might actually serve as markers
for impaired left ventricular function in patients with CHF.

In the first study of carnitine tissue levels and CHF, the myocardial tissue from 25 cardiac trans -
plant recipients with end-stage CHF and 21 control donor hearts was analyzed for concentrations of
total carnitine, free carnitine, and carnitine derivatives.

Compared to controls, the concentration of
carnitines in the heart muscle of heart transplant recipients was significantly lower in patients, and
the level of carnitine in the tissue was directly related to ejection fraction.

This study concluded that
carnitine deficiency in the heart tissue might be directly related to heart function.68
The second study measured plasma and urinary levels of L-carnitine in 30 patients with CHF and
cardiomyopathy and compared them to 10 control subjects with no heart disease.69 Results showed
that patients with CHF had higher plasma and urinary levels of carnitine, suggesting that carnitine
was being released from the challenged heart muscle cells.

Similarly, the results showed that the
level of plasma and urinary carnitine was related to the degree of left ventricular systolic dysfunc -
tion and ejection fraction, showing that elevated plasma and urinary carnitine levels—indices of
carnitines being leached out of compromised cardiomyocytes—might represent measurable physi -
ological markers for myocardial damage and impaired left ventricular function.

More recently, free L-carnitine levels and levels of its derivative palmitoyl-carnitine were
increased in CHF patients and correlated with NT-Pro-BNP and NYHA functional class status.

In
this study of 183 heart failure patients and 111 healthy controls, higher levels of palmitoyl-carnitine
were also associated with more adverse outcomes.

The authors believed these findings suggested
prognostic value and recommended additional investigational analysis of L-carnitine administra -
tion in heart failure candidates.70
A previous investigation examined the effect of long-term carnitine administration on mortality
in patients with CHF and dilated cardiomyopathy.

This study followed 80 patients with moderate to
severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) for 3 years.

After a 3-month period of stable cardiac func -
tion on normal medication, patients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 g of carnitine per
day or a matched placebo.

After an average of 33.7 months of follow-up 70 patients remained in the
study (33 taking placebo and 37 supplementing with carnitine), and at the end of the study period 63
had survived (27 placebo and 36 carnitine).

This study determined that carnitine provided a benefit
to longer term survival in late-stage heart failure in dilated cardiomyopathy.71
A similar placebo-controlled study evaluated 160 myocardial infarction survivors for 12 months.72
A total of 80 subjects were included in each group; the study group received a daily dose of 4 g of
L-carnitine, and the controls received a placebo.

Both the carnitine and control groups continued
their conventional therapeutic regimen while on the test substance.

Subjects in both groups showed
improvement in arterial blood pressure, cholesterol levels, rhythm disorders, and signs and symp -
toms of CHF over the study period, but all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the carnitine
group than the placebo group (1.2% and 12.5%, respectively).

A further double blind, placebo-
controlled trial by Singh and coworkers studied 100 patients with suspected myocardial infarction.

Patients taking carnitine (2 g/day for 28 days) showed improvement in arrhythmia, angina, onset of
heart failure, and mean infarct size, as well as a reduction in total cardiac events.

There was a sig -
nificant reduction in cardiac death and nonfatal infarction in the carnitine group versus the placebo
group (15.6% vs. 26%, respectively).73299 Metabolic Cardiology
In a European study of 472 patients published in the Journal of the American College of
Cardiology , 9 g/day of carnitine was administered intravenously for 5 days followed by 6 g/day orally
for the next 12 months.74 The study validated previous findings, demonstrating an improvement in
ejection fraction and a reduction in left ventricular size in carnitine-treated patients.

Although the
European study was not designed to demonstrate outcome differences, the combined incidence of
CHF death after discharge was lower in the carnitine group than the placebo group (6.0% vs. 9.6%,
respectively), a reduction of more than 30%.

In a later study, only 1500 mg of L-carnitine in 29 patients with NYHA class II symptoms and
preserved left ventricular function demonstrated not only an improvement in shortness of breath in
the carnitine group but also improved diastolic relationships on echocardiographic analysis after
only 3 months of treatment.75
The most recent review of the benefits of L-carnitine and cardiovascular function was reported
as a meta-analysis in the Mayo Clinic’s proceedings in 2013.76 A total of 13 clinical trials involving
3629 patients post-myocardial infarction (MI) were evaluated.

L-carnitine’s benefits were attributed
to the ability of L-carnitine to limit infarct size, stabilize membranes, and improve compromised
cellular energy production.

The major improvements in these vulnerable post-MI patients not only
showed a reduction of angina symptoms by 40% and reduced arrhythmia by 60% but a striking
reduction in all-cause death by 27%.76
A newer form of carnitine called glycine propionyl L-carnitine (GPLC) has demonstrated sig -
nificant advantages in the production of nitric oxide and lower malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker
of lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage.

This form of carnitine has demonstrated the important
property of vasodilation via a nitric oxide mechanism.

GPLC also blocked key steps in the process
of platelet aggregation and adhesion, as well as reducing levels of lipid peroxidation and oxidative
damage.77
To summarize, without carnitine fats, which are a high-energy fuel for the heart, cannot be
converted to ATP.

The heart uses free fatty acids as its main energy source, and the only way for
long-chain fatty acids to get to the inner mitochondrial membrane where energy is produced is via
the carnitine shuttle.

Thus, the addition of L-carnitine is very important in the synergy of metabolic
cardiology.

MAGNESIUM: SWITCHING ON THE ENERGY ENZYMES
Magnesium is an essential mineral that is critical for energy-requiring processes, in protein syn -
thesis, membrane integrity, nervous tissue conduction, neuromuscular excitation, muscle contrac -
tion, hormone secretion, maintenance of vascular tone, and intermediary metabolism.

Deficiency
may lead to changes in neuromuscular, cardiovascular, immune, and hormonal function; impaired
energy metabolism; and reduced capacity for physical work.

Magnesium deficiency is now consid -
ered to contribute to many diseases, and the role for magnesium as a therapeutic agent is expanding.

A published German study78 brings this point into focus.

Researchers in this study evaluated a random population of about 16,000 people, who were
assigned to subgroups based on gender, age, and state of health.

Low blood levels of magnesium,
or hypomagnesemia, was identified in 14.5% of all persons examined, and suboptimal levels were
found in yet another 33.7%—a total of 58.2%—more than half of those evaluated.78 Thus, low mag -
nesium situations are more common than we think.

Magnesium deficiency reduces the activity of important enzymes used in energy metabolism.

Hypomagnesemia can result in progressive vasoconstriction, coronary spasm, and even sudden
death.79 In anginal episodes due to coronary artery spasm, treatment with magnesium has been
shown to be efficacious.80
Magnesium deficiency, which is better detected by mononuclear blood cell magnesium than the
standard serum level performed at most hospitals, predisposes to excessive mortality and morbidity
in patients with acute MI.81300 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Unless we have adequate levels of magnesium in our cells, the cellular processes of energy
metabolism cannot function.

Small changes in magnesium levels can have a large effect on heart
and blood vessel function.

Although magnesium is found in most foods, particularly beans, figs,
and vegetables, deficiencies are increasing.

Softened water, depleted soils, and a trend toward lower
vegetable consumption are the culprits contributing to these rising deficiencies.

SUMMARY
The energy-starved heart is often not considered by physicians who treat cardiac disease on a
day-to-day basis.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor II blockers
improve survival in ischemic and nonischemic heart failure and should be considered as a conven -
tional approach in any patient with heart failure.

However, therapies that target the cardiomyocyte
itself must also be employed11 as it has been shown that the function of cardiomyocytes in the
failing heart, although metabolically compromised, can be potentially improved and restored.11
Therapies that go beyond symptomatic relief (diuretics), and the neurohormonal axis, must also be
considered that target the cellular, mitochondrial, and metabolic defects.

Metabolic support with
D-ribose, coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, and magnesium is critical for the maintenance of contrac -
tile reserve and energy charge in minimally oxidative ischemic or hypoxic hearts.

Preservation of
cellular energy charge provides the chemical driving force required to complete ATPase reactions
needed to maintain cell and tissue viability and function.

D-ribose, coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, and
magnesium exert a physiological benefit that has a positive impact on cardiac function.

A metabolic cardiology approach using these components is suggested here: when taking the
suggested amounts, it is recommended that the total dose be given in divided doses after breakfast
and after dinner.

For D-ribose, take 5-g (one scoop) dose, three times a day.

Mild to moderate CHF:
1.

Multivitamin/mineral foundation program with 1 g of fish or calamarine oil
2.

Coenzyme Q10: 300–400 mg
3.

L-carnitine: 2000–2500 mg

CONCLUSION
Cardiovascular function depends on the operational capacity of myocardial cells to generate the
energy to expand and contract.

Insufficient myocardial energy significantly contributes to CHF.

Literally, heart failure occurs when a heart is energy starved .

Although there may be several causes of myocardial dysfunction, the energy deficiency in car -
diac myocytes plays a significant role and is probably the major factor in CHF.

It is no longer enough 301 Metabolic Cardiology
that physicians focus on the fluid retention aspects of “pump failure.” For instance, diuretic thera -
pies target the kidneys indirectly to relieve the sequelae of CHF without addressing the root cause.

Inotropic agents attempt to increase contractility directly, yet fail to offer the extra energy necessary
to assist the weakened heart muscle.

Metabolic solutions, on the other hand, treat the heart muscle
cells directly.

Physicians must consider the biochemistry of “pulsation.” It is critically important to treat both
the molecular and the cellular components of the heart when managing CHF.

Remember, one char -
acteristic of the failing heart is the persistent and progressive loss of cellular energy substrates
and abnormalities in cardiac bioenergetics that directly compromise diastolic performance, with
the capacity to impact global cardiac function.

It took me 35 years of cardiology practice to learn
that the heart is all about ATP, and the bottom line in the treatment of any form of cardiovascular
disease, especially CHF and cardiomyopathy, is restoration of the heart’s energy reserve.

Metabolic
cardiology addresses the biochemical interventions that directly improve energy substrates and
therefore energy metabolism in heart cells.

In simple terms, sick hearts leak out and lose vital ATP
and the endogenous restoration of ATP cannot keep pace with the relentless depletion of energy
substrates, especially in situations of ischemia.

When ATP levels drop, diastolic function, the most
important precursor of CHF, deteriorates.

As epidemiological studies suggest that DD is present in
more than half of patients admitted to hospitals with CHF,82 it makes sense to target myocardial
energetics with effective modalities that truly work.

D-ribose, coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, and magnesium all act to promote cardiac energy metabo -
lism and help normalize myocardial adenine nucleotide concentrations.

These naturally occurring
compounds exert a physiological benefit that positively impacts diastolic heart function.

All are rec -
ommended as adjunctive metabolic therapies in the treatment of heart failure and cardiomyopathy.

Acknowledging this metabolic support for the heart provides the missing link that has been elud -
ing cardiologists for decades and offers hope for the future treatment of cardiovascular disease.

Energizing diastole and myocyte metabolism is the most effective therapy for diastolic heart failure
and some day may become the standard of care for all forms of heart disease82 and especially CHF.17,18
Such potential treatment strategies are currently being modulated from the bench to the bedside.17,83

INTRODUCTION
Life is incomplete without stress.

Stress creates the inflection points of our emotional experiences
of life, i.e., the roller coaster of life itself.

In the cognitive domain, stress creates motivation, vigi -
lance, and stimulates productivity.

Although many of us often wish for less stress, or maintain an
ideal vision of complete relaxation, without stress the experience of life would be bland, boring,
and blunted by a lack of emotional extremes.

The inherent requirement of stress for  having rich life
experiences was recognized in the mid-1900s by physician and chemist, Dr. Hans Selye, during his
research on the role glucocorticoids have in eliciting and maintaining the stress response.

In his
book, The Stress of Life ,1 Dr. Selye describes the connections between the brain and the adrenal
glands, articulating what has come to be known as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis.

In addition to describing the overall importance of stress, Dr. Selye also described stress—and
reactions to stress—along a continuum of optimally balanced vigilance and engagement in life to
exhaustion and chronic disease states, resulting from the long-term consequences of maladaptation
to stress.

Selye’s recommendation for dynamic balance in relation to stress is closely related to the
contemporary term “allostasis,” which refers to the simultaneous regulation of multiple physiologic
processes in response to physical, environmental and psychosocial challenges, i.e., stressors.2,3
Optimal allostasis, therefore, requires flexibility and dynamism, balancing multiple systems for
optimal performance.

However, even though the numerous interconnections in human physiology
provide checks and balances to maintain allostasis, all infrastructure has limitations (no matter how
expertly designed) and “allostatic load” refers to the gradual “wear and tear” of the various physi -
ologic mechanisms involved, i.e., long-term consequences of maladaptation.

The concept of “allostasis” is closely related to “resiliency.” By definition, resiliency is the
quality of an object (or individual!)

to hold or return to their shape after being bent, compressed,
or stretched (or stressed!).

With stress, building resiliency for regaining allostasis becomes an
important goal—and a much more sophisticated goal than simply prescribing antidepressants or
herbal adaptogens (although each may help as an element of a broader therapeutic strategy).

By
recognizing the importance of stress for living a dynamic life filled with rich emotional experiences
(vs. the scarier thought of living a bland life without stress), the goal changes from eliminating
stress, to managing stress by training ourselves and our patients to differentiate significant stressors
from background noise, and then choose when and how to react.

Guiding patients toward practicing
stress management and resiliency-building behaviors, e.g., meditation, socialization, and spiritual -
ity, can provide them with tools to quickly return to allostasis following even significant stressors.

These cumulative skills build resiliency to stress, and retrain previously reflexive reactions.

In this chapter, we describe some of the known connections between stress and cardiovascular
disease (CVD), including a discussion of emerging research on the genetic pathways triggered by
stress and careful exploration of “significant” stress and its contribution to CVD risk.

We then provide
a brief summary of the clinical evidence on numerous therapeutic interventions, including personal 307 Be the Willow
behavioral practices, mind–body interventions, combined physical and breathe practices, and formal
clinical programs, that can help patients build resilience to stress, regain allostasis, reduce allostatic
load, all of which help reduce their risk of significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

MECHANISMS OF STRESS
Our robust physiologic stress response, has provided us with numerous evolutionary advantages,
and ensured the survival of our species for millions of years.

The major hormones of stress—
epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol4,5—increased our blood pressure to deliver more oxygen
and nutrients to our muscles when we needed to run from aggressors, and chase after our food.

The
same hormones in different ratios helped us survive famine by blunting our sensitivity to insulin
and shifting our metabolism to generate fuel when needed using gluconeogenesis and  adipolysis.

However, whether for better or worse, the stressors  of life have changed but our physiological
response has remained conserved.

When under chronic stress, the same hormones that once pro -
tected us from our harsh environments now threaten our physiology with prolonged maladaptive
changes including the following:
• Impaired glucose metabolism via chronic cortisol elevations and aberrant gluconeogenesis
• Weight gain from disrupted diurnal cortisol rhythms
• Cardiac arrhythmia via skewed sympathetic to parasympathetic nervous tone
• Hypertension from elevated catecholamines
• Hyperlipidemia and excess circulated free fatty acids from lipolysis
• Increased inflammation, i.e., increased TNF- α, from elevated catecholamines
• Coronary spasm via skewed sympathetic to parasympathetic nervous tone
• Immune suppression from excess cortisol
• Increased anxiety from excess catecholamines
• Hypersensitivity to pain from increased inflammatory mediators6
Providing a genetically rooted explanation for the cellular dysfunction caused by stress, Bhasin
et al.

recently applied transcriptome analysis to identify the genes temporally affected by relax -
ation, and discovered relaxation response was associated with increased transcription of genes
associated with cellular energy metabolism, mitochondrial APT production, insulin secretion, telo -
mere maintenance, and reduced transcription of genes associated with chronic inflammation, i.e.,
NF-κB.7,8 These findings led the authors to coin “mitochondrial resilience” to describe the adaptive
changes that result from relaxation.

Thus mitochondrial maladaptation, i.e., reduced ATP produc -
tion, reduced energy metabolism, increased oxidative stress, and reduced telomere maintenance,
can be considered underlying cellular consequences of chronic stress.

This innovative concept pro -
vides mechanistic support for stress as a mitochondrial toxin that reduces its ability to respond
dynamically to a changing metabolic environment, i.e., maintains allostasis.

Is it not surprising
chronic stress has negative consequences for the most densely mitochondrial-laden tissue of the
body—the heart.

As described in detail by McEwen and Gianaros,9 central to our perception of potentially stress -
ful stimuli, and thus our response, are complex interactions of several brain centers, with reaction
originating in the deep emotional limbic centers of the brain, i.e., the amygdala, and then interact -
ing with our memory of life experiences, i.e., the hippocampus, and our rational, cognitive centers,
i.e., the prefrontal cortex.

Interestingly, our perceptions of stress and reactions to stressors are con -
nected to our developmental environment, including the in utero  environment and during early
childhood, including variables like food availability, parental nurturing behaviors, self-esteem, and
education.9–11 Therefore, our final reaction to stress is a complex mixture of voluntary and involun -
tary limbic responses, blended with a myriad of influences from our past experiences (e.g., injury,
reward, support, and isolation) and our cognitive beliefs.308 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
On one hand, the many influences on our response to stress may seem overwhelming and uncon -
trollable, i.e., we are destined to overreact and we can blame our parents; however, understanding
the neurobiology provides several opportunities for education and reprogramming.

For example,
educating patients on how their responses to stress are a combination of voluntary and involuntary
responses creates less judgment, provides an opportunity to query patients on past life experiences,
and provides an opportunity to focus on the voluntary elements of their stress reactions to stress
reprograming using cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, or other tech -
niques.

Also, the overarching regulating properties of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex,
suggest that stress response, and increased resiliency, can be re-trained through repetitive exposure
to potential stressors that do not need to lead to deleterious consequences, i.e., re-training social
interactions, forming healthy relationships, and so on.

Supporting this concept, animal studies in
rats suggest that with continued exposure to stressors without consequence, i.e., repeated immo -
bilization and forced swim testing, led to loss of fear memory and increased resiliency.4 Offering
patients reassurance and support, while encouraging them to face their fears and re-engage, may be
one effective approach to reprogramming a deeply wired response.

STRESS AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
Chronic maladaptation to stress leads to both increases in circulating stress hormones and disrupted
circadian rhythms of the normal cycles of stress hormones.

As described earlier, this chronic dys -
regulation has direct and indirect consequences to the cardiovascular system, i.e., increased heart
rate, blood pressure, oxidative stress, circulating blood fat, circulating blood sugar, and so on.

Yet,
many of these risk factors are multifactorial, influenced by diet, physical activity, genetics, and gen -
eral state of health, so what is the independent effect of stress on cardiovascular health?

Because of its robust design and wide-reaching international recruitment, the INTERHEART
case–control study has done more to increase the cardiology community’s appreciation for the
impact of stress on CVD risk than any other research to date.

INTERHEART was designed to
determine risk factors for first myocardial infarction (MI) and was conducted in 52 countries around
the world, accumulating over 15,000 events.12,13 The findings related to psychosocial stress and MI
risk were staggering, with increased psychosocial stress attributing over 30% of population attrib -
utable risk for first MI.

To thoroughly assess the contribution of stress to MI in INTERHEART,
it is important to learn how “stress” was defined in the study.

To thoroughly assess the contribution of stress to MI in INTERHEART,
it is important to learn how “stress” was defined in the study.

In INTERHEART, psychosocial
stress was measured as a composite index composed of scores from five domains of stress: stress at
home or at work, financial stress, past significant trauma (e.g., loss of a spouse or child), presence
of depression, and locus of control.13 Not surprisingly, having higher degrees of stress at work and
home, greater financial stress, having experienced major life stress (e.g., business failure, major
intra-family conflict, job loss, death of a spouse, and subject of violence), having depression, and/
or experiencing a low locus of control were all associated with increased risk for MI.

Each compo -
nent of the index contributes differently to the population attributable risk (see Table 13.1).

Of note,
although experiencing two or more major stressful events in life increased risk, business failure
and having a major intrafamily conflict lend the greatest increases in risk, whereas the frequency of
life stresses such as divorce, loss of another family member, or injury were similar between cases
and controls.

Of all psychosocial risk factors, depression has been the most studied in relation to its impact
on CVD.

The relationship between depression and CVD appears to be bidirectional,14 with major
depressive disorder being more common in CVD patients,15 as well as depression occurring as
a common sequelae to MI.16 The accumulation of evidence for positive associations between
depression and worsened CVD prognosis finally led to its recognition in 2014 as an indepen -
dent risk factor by the American Heart Association.17 Many studies suggest depression predis -
poses to cardiovascular events, and worsen prognosis once events occur.18–24 Depression worsens
outcomes in unstable angina, even after controlling for other prognostic factors, such as left 309 Be the Willow
ventricular ejection fraction and number of diseased vessels.25 Patients with depression after MI
are even more vulnerable, and experience higher mortality rates during the 18 months postinfarc -
tion than their nondepressed counterparts.22 Toward the end of one’s life journey, the absence of
depression may be more significant to chances of recovery from chronic illness and exhaustion
than history of CVD.26
Other studies before and since INTERHEART have recognized domains of psychosocial stress,
in addition to depression, to have an impact on CVD.

Supporting the significance of workplace
stress on CVD outcomes, the massive meta-cohort study by Kivimaki et al.

combined individual-
level data from 30 European cohorts studies, collecting a total of 197,473 participants, 15% of
whom reported job strain.

Job strain was associated with a significant independent risk factor for
coronary disease, contributing a 3.4% population attributable risk.27 In contrast to INTERHEART,
the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study demonstrated that
time, urgency/impatience, and hostility, but not depression or anxiety, were linked to increased
MI risk.28 Brackett et al.29 were among the first investigators to demonstrate a relationship between
a type “A”–driven personality and increased risk for adverse CVD outcome.

In their prospective
cohort study over 5 years, having a type “A” personality was an independent predictor of sudden
cardiac death.

POTENTIAL MECHANISMS FOR STRESS-INDUCED CVD
One potential behavioral mechanism for the higher morbidity and mortality witnessed in depressed
patients may be differential self-care, including reduced adherence to medications and other self-
care practices.

Ziegelstein et al.

found patients  with depression  reported lower inherence to  low-
fat-diet, regular-exercise, and stress-management plans.

found patients  with depression  reported lower inherence to  low-
fat-diet, regular-exercise, and stress-management plans.

Individuals with major depression also
reported taking their medications less often than prescribed .30 Individuals with depression are also
more likely to use alcohol excessively, which may also contribute to worsened outcomes.

However,
behavioral differences only accounted for a small percentage (3%) of the differences in CVD mor -
tality for people with depression included in the National Health Interview Study.31 Numerous bio -
chemical mechanisms have been proposed, including increased inflammatory cytokines, oxidative
stress, reduced heart rate variability (HRV), and tendency for coagulation.32 Cortisol reactivity has
also been proposed as a potential mechanism of stress-induced CVD, which is supported by the
findings of Hamer et al.

who found salivary cortisol concentrations correlated with progression of
coronary calcification in healthy men and women over 3 years .33 Clearly, part of the difficulty in
trying to find the mechanism is trying to separate the parts, rather than accepting depression as an
individualized biobehavioral syndrome—and that patients caught in the cycle of depression need to
be recognized, evaluated, and given help.TABLE 13.1

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN THE EFFECTS OF STRESS ON CVD
Fortunately, the effects of stress on CVD risk in women have been given special attention in CVD
research recently and suggest stress may have greater negative effects on women compared to
men.34–36 Specifically, stress and job strain are more likely to impact angina symptoms in women,36
and recurrent depression predicts worsening coronary artery calcification.34 These differences are
important to appreciate, as they correspond also with differences in the presentation of CVD symp -
toms in women,37 including a higher contribution of C-reactive protein (CRP) to risk (associated
with increased stress and depression)38,39 and a greater contribution of arteriole spasm to angina
symptoms (also associated with increased stress and depression).40 Notably, research suggests CRP
increased in women relative to men, and continues to increase in women beginning at puberty.37
Estrogen may mediate the effects of stress in women (and likely in men, though not well studied) as
clinical research suggests estrogen replacement therapy blunts the usual increases in both cortisol
and catecholamines following mental stress.41 Other potential mechanisms include increased sensi -
tivity of women to oxytocin—a hormone released during social interactions—which is theorized to
ameliorate the neuroendocrine and cardiovascular effects of stress.42
Not surprisingly, the concerns of women vary with age, with women over age 60 tending to
be concerned more with functional capacity, physical resiliency, and memory changes, whereas
women below 60 years of age tend to be more concerned with emotional issues regarding work and
family.35 The differences between men and women summarized here underscore the importance
of including a holistic history in the clinical encounter, including queries about emotional health,
home, and work stress, especially in women with symptoms of potential CVD and/or in women
with increased traditional CVD risk.

Thus, interventions, including cognitive behavior therapies
and other stress management interventions, should be tailored to meet the current needs of patients
based on their age, gender, and current risk, rather than relying on generalized recommendations.

THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS
Once a patient is identified with significant stressor, conventional Western medicine offers few non -
pharmacologic options, which may not be effective in the context of CVD.

Fortunately, there are
various nonpharmacological mind–body therapies that are effective treatments for stress.

Table 13.2
provides a summary of mind–body and other interventions that can be recommended to patients to
build intrinsic or extrinsic resiliency.

These therapies can be used in both inpatient and outpatient
care settings, and many of these techniques can be taught to the patient for self-treatment.

Once
patients learn stress reduction techniques, these techniques become tools they can use to reduce allo -
static load whenever necessary, and increasing the number of tools in one’s toolbox builds resiliency.

One goal shared by many mind–body and stress management practices in reaching the “relax -
ation response,” alters the ratio of sympathetic to parasympathetic tone, and thus increases HRV.

Lower HRV is an independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death, all-cause death, and the cardiac
event recurrence.43–46
THE THERAPEUTIC ENCOUNTER
The stress of life is real, and can have a significant deleterious effect on the cardiovascular risk
of our patients, and the outcomes of our patients with known CVD.

Our duty as physicians is to
identify, evaluate, and offer treatment for risk factors in an effort to prevent disease and reestablish
health.

The honor of being an integrative medicine provider is having a range of therapeutic options
to patients, which will help them build resilience and reduce their allostatic load.

However, neither
fancy devices nor disciplined meditation practices are likely to be effective unless we create the
space for a therapeutic encounter during which they can openly discuss their stress history and the
current impact of stress on their lives.

PERSONAL BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES
One of the many benefits of being integrative medicine providers is being able to empower our
patients to take control of their health, by directing them to personal and behavioral practices that
do not require formal programs or intensive interventions to be effective.

Many suggestions for
lifestyle modifications can be made to patients, letting their preferences and philosophies guide the
final choices for intervention.

Behavioral changes, such as getting out more into the community,
reconnecting with friends, and volunteering, are relatively simple ways to encourage patients to
build resiliency to stress.

socialization  and Social SuPPort
Life is stressful—share the (allostatic) load!

Supporting the concept that resiliency can be improved by
building community, social support may influence prognosis in CVD.

In participants of the CAST-1
trial, perceived social support was a significant independent predictor of mortality from arrhythmia.47

In participants of the CAST-1
trial, perceived social support was a significant independent predictor of mortality from arrhythmia.47
Although, Frasure-Smith et al.

found elevated Beck depression scores were correlated to cardiac
mortality, and the association between depression and mortality decreased with increasing social
support.22 Notably, social support was related to greater-than-expected improvement in depression
symptoms for those survivors who were depressed at baseline, and those with higher baseline depres -
sion scores .

Therefore, although post-MI depression is a predictor of 18-month mortality, social sup -
port can decrease the magnitude of depression, providing some evidence for a potential mechanism
of  social support in the improvement cardiovascular outcomes.

Craig et al.

demonstrated a significant
relationship between increased social support and reduced cardiovascular reactivity in MI survivors.48
VOLUNTEERISM
One of the greatest lessons of life is learning the many benefits of generosity, “In giving, we receive.”
Again, suggesting the importance of service, social connection, and reaching out beyond one’s self, vol -
unteerism has been linked to less depression and pain, less anxiety, and a greater sense of life purpose.49
PET OWNERSHIP
Pet ownership can not only provide medical benefits associated with stress reduction but also
convey a sense of companionship and purpose.

A wide variety of research methods demonstrated
support for both physical and psychological health benefits of pet ownership, including less 312 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
depression, lower cardiovascular risk, fewer physician visits, and reduced mortality.50–52 Pet own -
ership appears to be effective in building resiliency, reducing the impact of stress and perhaps
mimicking the effects of social support.53 Pet ownership may be particularly helpful after MI, a
vulnerable time during which owning a pet appears to reduce depression and increase HRV.50,54
SPIRITUALITY
We define spirituality as any path that leads to the recognition of the Divine.

Meta-analyses support
the role of spirituality and spiritual practices to increase coping, and build resiliency to stress,55
and multiple studies have been conducted linking religious practices and spirituality with improved
health and lower rates of heart disease.56–59 Supporting the concept that self-care behaviors are
improved by improving coping strategies for stress, people who are religious tend to have greater
adherence to medication, exercise more, eat healthier diets, drink less alcohol, quit smoking more
readily and use more preventive services.59 Some observational data supports that these behaviors
translate into improved health outcomes:
• Secular Jewish persons had significantly higher odds for the first MI compared to Orthodox
Jewish patients (odds ratio: 4.2 for men and 7.3 for women) after adjustments for age, eth -
nicity, education, smoking, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI).58
• A 23-year prospective study of more than 10,000 Israeli civil servants and municipal
employees found that Orthodox Jewish men had a 20% decreased risk of fatal coronary
heart disease compared with nonreligious men, after adjusting for age, blood pressure,
lipids, smoking, diabetes, BMI, and baseline coronary heart disease.57
• A prospective study of 232 people (age, 55 years) undergoing elective heart surgery found
that lack of participation in social groups and lack of strength or comfort from religion
were the most consistent predictors of death, after adjusting for age, previous cardiac sur -
gery, and preoperative functional status.56
PRAYER
Investigating a sample of caregivers under a moderate burden of stress, Wilks et al.60 demon -
strated the use of prayer increased with the magnitude of stress, but prayer was also associated with
improved resiliency compared to those participants who did not pray.

GRATITUDE
Although many of us were taught to express thanks to friends, family, and the Divine, how many
of us truly remember every day to be thankful for our breath, and for the opportunity to follow the
dynamic path of life?

Although the science of gratitude is relatively new, gratitude as an element of
positive outlook has been linked to reduced depression,61 improved cardiac outcomes,62 and recom -
mended as a strategy to build resiliency and improve well-being.63
MIND–BODY PRACTICES
Mind–body practices help create mental calm, affect allostasis, and offer multiple strategies for
developing resiliency in our patients.

Once learned, mind–body practices can be practiced nearly
anywhere, from home to an elevator during a busy workday.

Both assisted (e.g., biofeedback) and
unassisted (e.g., guided imagery) exercises are accessible to patients depending on their interests
and preferences .313 Be the Willow
breat Hing exercises
Breathing exercises, including the breath exercises inherent in meditation and yoga, have been part
of spiritual traditions for thousands of years.

One of our favorite mantras to use with patients in
the clinic is: “The mind controls the body.

The breath controls the mind.” Followed by a breathing
exercise, this mantra immediately redirects the focus to the breath, and away from the physical
symptoms, and expands their shallow breathing.

Breathing exercises can result in a 6- to 9-mmHg
reduction in BP.64 Practice inhaling for a count of two, then exhaling for a count of two, gradually
lengthen the breathing to counts of three, four, or more for a target breathing rate of six to seven
breaths per minute.

It is important to note that as soon as it feels like a struggle or competition, you
are no longer in the parasympathetic zone.

Other types of self-guided relaxation, including progressive muscle relaxation, are effective
at eliciting a relaxation response.65 Progressive muscle relaxation encourages relaxation through
awareness of the sensations present in the main muscle groups.

For example, first take a few  quieting
breaths and then focus on your feet, either simply bringing awareness to any muscle tension there
or intentionally contracting the muscles, then, exhaling, relaxing, and releasing the tension.

Next,
move your attention to the lower leg and repeat the tensing and relaxing.

This technique aims to
elicit the relaxation response through this repetitive mental focus and intentional adoption of a
relaxed state.

guided  iMagery  and HyPnosis
Guided imagery uses the power of thought to influence psychological states and physiological func -
tions.

Guided imagery is a therapeutic technique that allows an individual to use his or her own
imagination to achieve a desirable outcome such as decreased pain perception and reduced anxiety.

Guided imagery has been studied as a pre-and postsurgical intervention in cardiothoracic surgery
patients, and it showed reductions in both pain and anxiety.66 Reaching a state of hypnosis, or a
state of heightened mental focus and awareness, often involves guided imagery.

Hypnosis has been
limitedly evaluated in CVD, but available results suggest hypnosis can increase HRV by reducing
sympathetic tone, reduce blood pressure, and improve anxiety .67,68
Meditation
Interest in formal meditation practices was ignited in the United States with the introduction of
Transcendental Meditation (TM) by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1967.

Instruction is offered in sim -
ple breathing techniques.

TM is practiced for 20 minutes twice daily, and offers a simple, unique
technique for meditation and relaxation.

It is one of the most studied integrative medicine therapies

It is one of the most studied integrative medicine therapies
with research dating back to 1970s.

Both observational research and clinical trials suggest benefits of TM, leading to its recent
“Level B” evidence ranking for the treatment of hypertension by the American Heart Association in
a recent scientific statement.69 Research by Schneider et al.70 in adults over age 55 with hypertension
demonstrated those who practiced TM had improved blood pressure and reduced cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality over 5 years.

More recently, Schneider et al.71 extended their observational
findings to clinical trials and demonstrated a 48% reduction in risk for primary composite cardio -
vascular endpoints in black men and women who practiced TM compared to controls.

Additional
clinical trials have showed improved blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and HRV from TM prac -
tice, suggesting TM activates a relaxation response.72 Providing evidence of a potential effect of
meditation on atherosclerotic disease regression, 9 months of TM practice reduced carotid intimal
medial thickness (IMT) in black Americans with hypertension, compared to increased carotid IMT
in controls.73314 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
MindFulness -based stress reduction
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program that teaches meditation
focused on moment-to-moment awareness.

MBSR utilizes the techniques of mindfulness medita -
tion, gentle yoga, and coordinated deep breathing to decrease pain and anxiety.

A meta-analysis
investigating MBSR for a wide spectrum of clinical populations demonstrated MBSR was effective
at alleviating stress and suffering associated with various diseases.74 Numerous studies have shown
perceived improvement in quality of life, reduced symptoms of stress, and improved sleep quality
from MBSR practices.75–77
More specific to CVD, Hughes et al.78 conducted a randomized controlled trial of MBSR, com -
pared to progressive muscle relaxation (another mind–body practice for stress reduction), for high
blood pressure.

After 8 weeks, MBSR resulted in significant reductions in systolic ( −4.8 mmHg)
and diastolic blood pressure ( –1.9 mmHg), greater than reductions achieved from progressive mus -
cle relaxation.

Similar benefits on blood pressure were measured by Parswani et al.79 when they
evaluated MBSR in men with coronary heart disease.

In their 3-month trial, people randomized
to MBSR had significant reductions in anxiety, depression, perceived stress, blood pressure ( −2.8
mmHg systolic/ –1.9 mmHg diastolic), and BMI.

Although not a formal trial, we recently published
a compelling case report describing a patient’s experience in which MBSR training reduced her
blood pressure from “stage 2” ( >160/100) to the normal after 11 weeks.80 MBSR also has established
benefits in obesity, including reductions in risk factors relevant to CVD risk.

Dalen et al.81 evalu -
ated a mindfulness intervention in a group of obese men and found after 3 months that mindfulness
practice improved weight loss, binge eating, depression, and perceived stress while lowering CRP.

Biofeedback involves monitoring and displaying physiological information directly to the patient,
including heart rate, muscle tension, and skin temperature, allowing for instruction on methods to
improve HRV and other risk factors.

During monitoring, patients are taught relaxation techniques
such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation.

Lehrer et al.82,83 demonstrated that training sub -
jects to maximize peak heart rate differences, i.e., increase HRV, using biofeedback could increase
homeostatic reflexes, lower blood pressure, and improve lung function.

In cardiovascular patients,
biofeedback can be used effectively to reduce stress, increase HRV, improve exercise tolerance, and
lower blood pressure, including both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.84–89 A recent American
Heart Association scientific review committee assigned “Level B” evidence to biofeedback tech -
niques for reducing blood pressure.69
There are many tools and techniques that can be used to provide biofeedback to patients  including
thermometers, heart rate monitors, and computer-assisted devices to measure breathing, pulse, and
muscle tension.

One of the best studied is the Resp-e-Rate (InterCure, New York) device.

The device
was approved by FDA for the treatment of hypertension, and generally consists of  breathing monitor
linked to headphones.

The device then senses the breathing pattern and provides audio guidance
about how to change your breathing patterns to optimize a parasympathetic respiratory pattern
(longer, slower breaths).

In clinical trials, Resp-E-Rate users have reduced their blood  pressure at
an average of 14 mmHg systolic (the top number) and 8 mmHg diastolic (the bottom number).90
Another similar device is Healing Rhythms (Wild Divine, San Diego, California).

Even better, each
of these devices is covered by some insurers.

HeartMatH
Similar to biofeedback, but anchored more on the emotional plane, is HeartMath.

HeartMath is
a series of techniques that helps people focus on their emotional responses to stress.

We all know
what it feels like to “get our blood pumping” when we are angry; that is an example of an emotional 315 Be the Willow
response to stress causing high blood pressure.

In fact, it is thought that the expression “seeing red”
relates to blood vessels dilating in the eyes in response to really high blood pressure.

HeartMath has nothing to do with arithmetic; it uses a concept called rhythm coherence  based
on the premise that modern life stressors influence the coherence of heart rhythms, and that the
coherence itself can be influenced by intentionally and sincerely focusing on positive feelings.

In
general, the techniques help you focus on remembering positive experiences (and how the mind–
body feel in those situations) and then cultivating the ability to “interrupt” yourself when negative
feelings begin.

There are many specific exercises used to teach participants to develop this pattern.

HeartMath focuses attention on the heart, uses heart-centered breathing (described as extending
the exhalation longer than the inhalation) and other mind–body exercises such as “freeze-frame.”91
People who practice HeartMath principles generally experience blood pressure reductions of about
10 mmHg.

MIXED-BREATHING AND PHYSICAL PRACTICES
yoga
Although the asanas of yoga have sprung up in most gyms and strip malls, there is still a long way
to go before the other elements of traditional yoga take root.

From its beginning, yoga was neither a
physical nor a breathing practice, but a way of being.

The eight limbs of yoga foster changes in men -
tal attitude, social practices, diet, the practice of asanas (postures), breathing practices (pranayamas),
and meditation to reach a higher realm of being, closer to the Divine.

When practiced completely,
behavioral qualities of nonviolence, satisfaction, restraint, and honesty, combine with disciplined
physical and mental practices, to create clarity, interconnection, and resilience.

Specific to CVD, yoga deserves mention in the context of several specific clinical conditions.

Hypertension is probably the most studied, and most intuitive, application of yoga practice.

Specific to CVD, yoga deserves mention in the context of several specific clinical conditions.

Hypertension is probably the most studied, and most intuitive, application of yoga practice.

However,
research on yoga for hypertension show mixed results,92–95 leading to its evidence ranking of “Level
C” by the American Heart Association in their recent scientific statement on nondrug approaches
to hypertension.69 Cardiac arrhythmia may be more sensitive to effects of yoga, and clinical trial
results suggest reductions in ectopic beats in people with palpitations,96 and improvements in par -
oxysmal atrial fibrillation.97 In the YOGA My Heart trial, yoga practice reduced heart rate, num -
ber of fibrillation episodes, and blood pressure in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation while
reducing depression and anxiety and improving all domains of health-related quality of life.97
Yoga has also demonstrated benefits in established coronary artery disease, including stabiliza -
tion and improvement in angina symptoms, increased myocardial perfusion, and regression of ath -
eroma volume.98,99 Notably, adherence to the yoga-based stress management program in the famous
Lifestyle Heart Trial, which demonstrated reversal of coronary disease by intensive lifestyle modi -
fication, was strongly associated with the degree of reduction in plaque volume during the course
of the trial.100,101
Supported mechanisms for the beneficial effects of yoga on vascular health include improvement
in endothelial function,102 perhaps secondary to reduced lipid peroxidation.103
tai CHi
Tai chi is an element of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that implements coordination of dif -
ferent breathing patterns with a variety of flowing postures and body motions.

Supporting benefit of
tai chi in patients with CVD, several small randomized trials in people with stable NYHA stage II
chronic heart failure and preserved ejection fraction have evaluated tai chi training vs. usual care
for changes in functional capacity and mood.104–106 Improvements measured in patients receiving
tai chi included improved mood, quality of life, 6-minute walk distance, exercise self-efficacy, and
serum B-type natriuretic peptide levels.316 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
qi gong
Qi gong is an element of TCM that implements coordination of different breathing patterns with a
variety of physical postures and body motions.

It is a very safe low-impact form of physical exercise
and meditation, and can be performed by almost anyone including patients with exercise-limiting
diseases.

Qi gong practice can be implemented at home on a daily basis.

Although Qi gong is often
taught for general health maintenance, it can be used as a therapeutic intervention.

Qi gong has
demonstrated benefits for rehabilitation in congestive heart failure and reducing hypertension while
reducing generalized stress and anxiety.107–110 Although some controversy remains over the benefits
of Qi gong on hypertension, it appears to be at least as effective as the positive controls used in the
trials.

Reductions in blood pressure during Qi gong practice were correlated with reduced con -
centrations of catecholamines, suggesting Qi gong can effectively induce a relaxation response.111
Research by Sun et al.

in people with type 2 diabetes demonstrated that daily Qi gong practice
reduced blood sugar and decreased perceived stress, whereas students also trended toward lower
rates of depression and reduced body weight.112–114

demonstrate the positive impact stress reduc -
tion can have on cardiovascular endpoints.

Blumenthal116 demonstrated stress management sig -
nificantly reduces the risk of events in patients with CVD.

One hundred and thirty-six patients
with CVD were randomized to usual care, physical activity training, or stress management.

Stress management training consisted of sixteen 1½-hour sessions during which patients were
instructed in biofeedback and progressive muscle relaxation.

Both endothelial function and HRV
improved in the stress management intervention.

Previous observational research by Blumenthal
et al.117 suggested a 50% reduction in cardiac events for patients with coronary artery disease who
attended their hospital-based stress management program.117 Stress management programs appear
to prolong life in women with CVD.

Orth-Gomer et al.118 reported that women randomized to a
stress management program after MI (including 20 sessions over a year that provided education
about risk factors, training on relaxation techniques, methods for self-monitoring, and cognitive
restructuring, with an emphasis on coping with stress exposure from family and work, plus self-
care and compliance with clinical advice) had a 67% reduction in cardiovascular mortality over
7 years of follow-up.

However, not all research has demonstrated benefit of protocolized stress
reduction interventions on cardiovascular risk factors.

The Trials of Hypertension Prevention
(THOP-I) tested whether a standardized stress management intervention, including group and
individual sessions during training on four relaxation methods, techniques to reduce stress reac -
tions, cognitive approaches, communication skills, time management, and anger management,
would lower systolic blood pressure.

Only minor changes in blood pressure resulted, including
a small, but significant −1.36 mmHg reduction in the intervention subgroup who were higher
adherent.119 Despite some conflicting results, Düsseldorp et al.

mortality.120 Sure sounds like stress management programs should be an element of best practices
in care for CVD.

Adherence to the stress management program was associated
with reduced stenosis diameter at both 1- and 5-year follow-up evaluations.101 Daubenmier et al.

also demonstrated additive and interrelated effects of stress reduction, improved diet, and increased
physical activity on reduced cardiovascular risk.121
However, not all comprehensive lifestyle programs have demonstrated reversal of coronary
artery calcification (CAC).122 The SAFE-LIFE trial measured no change in CAC after a 3-year
intervention consisting of stress management techniques, including mindfulness meditation, guided
imagery, yoga breathing techniques, and body scan, plus CBT and training in coping.123 SAFE-
LIFE participants were also encouraged toward a Mediterranean diet, and encouraged (but not
trained) to increase their physical activity.

Despite not demonstrating reductions in CAC, SAFE-
LIFE participant did experience reductions in blood pressure, heart rate, and doses of anti-ischemic
medications.

Notably, the SAFE-LIFE intervention was much less intensive then the intervention
in the Lifestyle Heart Trial, i.e., Mediterranean vs. very low-fat diet, physical activity recommen -
dations versus specific training, and individual vs. group stress management practice, which may
explain the differential results.100,123
Supporting the concept that multibehavioral lifestyle change may be effective at the cellular level,
only “multisystem resiliency”—defined by Puterman et al.

as healthy emotion regulation, strong
social connections, and health behaviors (sleep and exercise)—and not improvement in individual
domains of resiliency, moderated the strong association between depression and reduced telomere
length.124 The biological importance of building multidimensional resiliency is supported by other
findings by Ornish et al., who demonstrated that increased telomere length results from compre -
hensive lifestyle change—and that increases in telomere length were associated with reductions in
psychological stress (and also reductions in low-density lipoproteins [LDL]).125 However, to bring
this discussion full circle, because telomere regulation and metabolic regulation are closely linked
through the mitochondria,126 this concept could be extended as multisystem resilience  leading to
increased mitochondrial resiliency.

CONCLUSION
Stress is inherent to a dynamic life, filled with diverse experiences and emotions.

Therefore, the
therapeutic goal becomes helping patients identify significant stressors, and adapt effectively by
reaching allostasis, or a dynamic balance with stress.

Chronic maladaptation to psychosocial stress
is an important independent risk factor for developing primary CVD, and for worsened outcomes
for those with CVD.

Although pharmacological therapies can reduce the symptoms of anxiety and
depression associated with financial stress, workplace stress, and past trauma, drugs do not pro -
vide patients with long-lasting approaches to build either extrinsic or intrinsic resiliency to stress.

Numerous therapeutic strategies are available to the integrative medicine provider to help patients
build resiliency including recommendations for socialization, spirituality, prayer, pet ownership,
as well as personal practices like yoga and meditation.

Finally, formal stress management pro -
grams and comprehensive lifestyle change programs, when available, offer structured and effective 318 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
alternatives to home-based personal practices, and may lead to significant stabilization or reversal
of CVD, including coronary disease.

However, before teaching our patients to bend like the wil -
low, rather than break under the load, we must first listen and learn about the impact of stress on
their life and relationships.

357,"Chunk 357:
However, before teaching our patients to bend like the wil -
low, rather than break under the load, we must first listen and learn about the impact of stress on
their life and relationships.

Helping our patients open their hearts to the experiences, pleasures, and
disappointments of life, while helping them protect themselves by developing the skills to maintain
dynamic balance through life’s stressors, is a lofty, but achievable goal, through the practice of
integrative medicine.

Special Considerations
Stephen T. Sinatra
For decades, cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death and disability for
both men and women in the United States.

In 2010 alone, it claimed almost 600,000 lives, the
majority of which were people over the age of 64 years.1  Cancer comes a close  second , followed
at a distance by chronic lower respiratory diseases, strokes, and accidents.

One of the main rea -
sons why CVD is such a deadly enemy may be lack of recognition of its more subtle signs and
symptoms until it is too late.

The good news is that you can help prevent or reverse CVD before
it’s too late.

“MODUS OPERANDI ” OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE
CVD is usually characterized by coronary artery disease, a condition of blood vessel damage due
to a combination of silent inflammation, endothelial deterioration, and plaque buildup.

When the
integrity of blood vessels becomes compromised, a silent but deadly process unfolds over time.

As
arteries may start to calcify, continually pumping blood through the body becomes a more  strenuous
activity for the heart and blood pressure may rise.

Chronic high blood pressure, or hypertension, is
major risk factor for CVD.

Additionally, as the immune system constantly repairs  damage in blood
vessels, blood vessel walls get more inflamed.

As inflammation increases, so does the likelihood
that plaques in arterial walls will become unstable and rupture.

When unstable plaques break open,
blood clots can enter the bloodstream, get lodged in blood vessels, and block blood flow.

Although heart disease is the number one cause of death among both women and men,2,3 CVD is
still often overlooked as a significant women’s health issue.

This may be due to a misunderstanding
by the medical community about how heart disease manifests in women.

CVD,2,3 and not breast
cancer, is the leading cause of death for women.

For nearly three decades, in fact, more women
than men have died each year from cardiovascular causes and nearly two-thirds of them who died
suddenly had no previous symptoms.

It is thus very important to identify at-risk women early so that
effective prevention strategies can be started.CONTENTS

Over the year, in articles and lectures, and in working with my own patients, I have tried to
educate women to be alert to the uniqueness of their gender when it comes to cardiovascular issues.

Women have generally been lumped together and treated similarly as men.

As I wrote in my 2000
book Heart Sense for Women4 (Lifeline Press), men and women are definitely different when it
comes to heart health factors and treatment.

Until recently, medical school training rarely prepared physicians to recognize symptoms of
CVD that are specific to women.

Instead, because for so many years the traditional prototype for
diagnosing and treating heart disease had been the middle-aged man, physicians were taught to
diagnose and treat what manifests as CVD in men.

The diagnosis of heart disease in the female is a
much more difficult process compared to men.

Although women generally are better in touch with their emotional pain and stress than men are,
they tend to experience more subtle or vague physical symptoms of heart disease and cardiac events
than men.

Whereas men may experience a crushing pain in their chests (angina) when having a
heart attack, women’s symptoms may include the following:
• Discomfort, pressure, or pain in the chest and/or back
• Tingling or pain in the jaw, elbow, or arm (both men and women tend to feel pain in the left
elbow or arm when having ischemia)
• Shortness of breath and/or light-headedness with exertion
• Sudden, profound fatigue
• Tightness in the throat
• Dizziness and/or vertigo
• Indigestion (women often feel that if they could “just burp,” they would feel better)
• Nausea and/or vomiting
• Disproportionate sweating with activity
Sometimes, women’s symptoms are mild enough for them to think they just have the flu and doc -
tors may misdiagnose women’s symptoms as other, less serious conditions such as hypoglycemia,
indigestion, muscle strain, or simply just anxiety or stress.

365,"Chunk 365:
Myocardial ischemia may be manifested
as both typical and atypical symptoms in women.

In my experience, the diagnosis of angina in
women is more complex and a poorly understood process.

Angina—chest pain often described as a “heart cramp”—is a symptom of ischemia, restricted
blood flow that results in an insufficient supply of oxygen to heart and other vital tissues.

Most often,
ischemia is due to plaque buildup in coronary arteries (CVD), which causes a partial blockage;
but it can also be caused by a blood clot, which completely blocks blood flow and may result in a
heart attack.

Without enough oxygen, the heart quickly becomes depleted of the energy it needs to
continue circulating blood throughout the rest of the body; it begins to cramp, and the person feels
numbness and/or pain.

As angina can be a sure sign of a heart issue, it’s crucial for both women and health  professionals
alike to recognize women’s symptoms.

With men, angina is typically felt as a sharp, crushing pain
in the middle of the chest or on either side.

Women, on the other hand, tend to experience dull or
aching  pain, or even just a sense of heaviness, tightness, soreness, or pressure in the chest.

Also,
with men, angina pain usually comes on after exercise or exertion and generally improves with rest;
women may experience it without any obvious cause or remedy, and rest may not help.

Women’s angina symptoms might even be mistaken for heartburn (women commonly feel a
need to just burp to feel better), and women may not know they have angina and are therefore at
risk for a heart attack, until the condition is dire.

Gastrointestinal distress is often one of the most
commonly disregarded signs of CVD.

Women also tend to feel pain or pressure radiating into their
jaws or necks; they could easily seek help at the dentist’s office instead of going to the hospital with
such symptoms.

I remember one woman who had a cardiac arrest in the emergency room as she was
waiting to see an oral surgeon for jaw pain.327 Women and Heart Disease
For men and women alike, shortness of breath and sudden fatigue are often early warning signs
that the heart isn’t getting enough oxygenated blood.

However, whereas the onset of these symptoms
is usually sudden in men, women tend to experience chronic breathlessness or may awaken in the
middle of the night with difficulty catching their breath.

Women’s fatigue may be unexplained or
generalized.

One possible explanation for these differences is that women may be more in tune with changes
in their bodies that indicate heart disease.

Unfortunately for men, a heart attack is all too often
the initial symptom that is recognized.

The other side of the coin is that women may also be
more prone to dismiss their pain and discomfort, having learned to bear the physical effects of
menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth; they may not seek medical attention until the situation
becomes dire.

Also, some women may incorrectly associate and write off menopausal discomforts, such as
sweating, irregular heartbeat, insomnia, and irritability, as aging, when in fact they may be subtle
symptoms of cardiac disease.

A woman’s risk of having a cardiac event significantly increases after she goes through meno -
pause.

This is because of her gradual loss of heart-protective estrogen.

As a woman ages, she tends
to experience a greater increase in lipid levels, high blood pressure, weight gain, and hormonal
imbalance.

Younger women, although less commonly, have heart attacks too.

They are oftentimes “vitally
exhausted,” from working, caring for or raising children and/or other family members, or pos -
sibly enduring rough emotional situations like divorce or death of loved ones.

Feeling burned out,
overloaded, and stressed is an indication of potential cardiac problems, even for people who appear
healthy on the surface.

Feeling burned out,
overloaded, and stressed is an indication of potential cardiac problems, even for people who appear
healthy on the surface.

Excessive stress not only depletes the immune system and leads to the
inflammation that causes CVD but also causes blood to thicken and blood pressure to rise.

Although
estrogen protects younger women, it will not, on its own, prevent heart attacks.

Stress management
is one key to preventing heart attacks in all ages of women, as well as men.

Statistically, men tend to experience cardiac events about a decade earlier than women.

But, in
general, they have a better chance at recovery.

Also, men usually report symptoms that appear as
“mechanical difficulties” or changes in physical function in their bodies, rather than as problems of
the heart, or of their emotional lives.

With women, cardiac complications may not present recogniz -
able symptoms and may be mistaken for general malaise.

Many coronary-related events in women
are actually “silent” heart attacks, where symptoms remain unrecognized and treatment is delayed
or neglected.

Such a silent heart attack may be recognized only when an electrocardiogram ( EKG)
is routinely done sometime afterward.

Another factor that is more prevalent in women compared to men in my experience is the use of
denial as a maladaptive coping mechanism.

According to the dictionary,5 denial, psychologically speaking, means “a condition in which
someone will not admit that something sad, painful, etc., is true or real.” Denial in cardiology
refers to a fairly common habit among patients to not admit that they have a heart problem .

Such
denial can be deadly.

Too often, I have seen patients who even with severe chest or arm pain mini -
mize their symptoms by calling them something else, anything other than heart pain.

And all too
often, I treated them afterward for serious heart attacks.

Individuals who deny they have a medical emergency are jeopardizing not only their health but
also their very life.

Over the years, many patients, even those experiencing severe chest and arm
pain, would try to minimize their situation, saying that they had something other than a heart condi -
tion.

Often, I would treat these deniers for serious heart attacks.

I remember one man many years ago who was a woodcutter.

He had severe left arm pain for
4 days that practically brought him to tears.

He was convinced it was bursitis.

At one point, he went
into heart failure and passed out.

In the emergency room, he developed ventricular fibrillation and
we shocked him back and he survived.

Afterward, he was totally stunned by the realization that
he’d had a heart attack.328 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
You might think that such kind of denial is a “macho” or manly thing.

But it’s not.

Both genders
fall into the denial trap.

I vividly recall the case of a woman in her fifties who developed chest pain
while hosting a dinner party.

The pain had risen up to her jaw.

She postponed going to the emer -
gency room until hours later at 1:00 a.m., after her final guest had departed.

She had a massive heart
attack and almost died in the emergency room.

Later, she told me that she didn’t think she could
possibly have a heart problem.

Women, research indicates, often delay seeking help because they
think heart disease is an almost always male problem and they prefer to self-medicate.

The fact is
that more women than men die of heart attacks.

Whether you are a man or a woman, denial is absolutely a real cardiovascular risk factor.

I have
treated dozens of patients in total denial, not only of their symptoms of heart disease but also of
heart damage itself.

In cardiology today, such denial is regarded seriously because when deniers delay or refuse
to seek medical care they lose out on the benefits (including lower mortality rates) achieved
by recent advances in treatment.

The American Heart Association has waged public educa -
tion  campaigns for years emphasizing that about half of all heart attack deaths occur within
1 hour after symptoms appear and usually outside the hospital.

Outcomes are clearly optimized
when care is obtained during that first hour after symptom onset.

Many deniers receive care
significantly later.

In a 2010 study6 involving over 100,000 people with a relatively mild form of heart attack in
which a blood clot doesn’t totally occlude a particular coronary artery, researchers found that the
average patient came to the hospital about 2½ hours after first feeling the symptoms.

It was note that
11% of the patients waited 12 or more hours before putting in a 9-1-1 call or getting to the hospital.

Seniors, women, nonwhites, smokers, and diabetics tended to delay the most.

In a Swedish study of first-time heart attacks, involving 78 men and 29 women, researchers
monitored whether the patients sought help within or beyond 4 hours and also whether they attended
a follow-up rehabilitation program.

The results are as follows: a total of 49 patients procrastinated,
and 76 failed to participate in rehabilitation.

The researchers interviewed all patients and found that
“high deniers” were both delayers and nonattenders.7
Years ago, people were reluctant to come into the emergency room even with chest pain.

Thanks
to the advent of thrombolytic and stent therapy, there has been a huge advance in treatment and sur -
vival.

The earlier you get in, the faster you get blood flow revived and the better the survival.

Such
early stenting in acute heart attack is the most important factor in surviving, and limiting infarct
size.

Although chest pain is the most common symptom of pre-infarction angina for both men and
women, women were still more likely to present without chest pain than men in a cohort study of
1015 patients of which 30% were women.8
I try to closely follow cardiovascular research.

My antenna is always alert to new revelations that
can help women better understand their uniqueness and take appropriate and timely action.

With that
in mind, I want to share new details regarding four underreported areas of  cardiovascular concern
for women: hypertension, lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD), diastolic  dysfunction
(DD), and mitral valve prolapse (MVP).

Before my book, Heart Sense for Women ,4 I tended to treat men and women with hypertension
in the same way.

As I wrote the book, it became clear that there were real gender-specific issues that
I needed to recognize as a clinician.

More recently, a comprehensive review article in the journal
Hypertension Research9 made this point unequivocally clear.

Here are some conclusions from that article:
• Aside from smoking cessation, hypertension control is the single most important interven -
tion to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events in women.

• Total life expectancy is almost 5 years less for women of 50 years with high blood pres -
sure compared to those without it.

Early high blood pressure is considered if your level is 329 Women and Heart Disease
over 130 (systolic) or 84 (diastolic).

More recent teaching suggests optimal blood pressure
readings of 120/80 and lower.

• Among the elderly, high blood pressure actually affects more women than men and, in
general, is underdiagnosed and undertreated.

The article, written by two Emory University researchers, covers various hormonal and meno -
pause factors.

For instance, there is a slight but significant increase in blood pressure among women
taking the widely prescribed, but risky, pharmaceutical hormone replacement therapy of equine
estrogen (Premarin) and medroxyprogesterone (Provera) to relieve menopausal symptoms.9,10
I vividly recall a patient in her late fifties who had developed a leaking mitral valve related to a
sudden increase in blood pressure.

She had no history of hypertension.

She had no history of hypertension.

Her doctor prescribed differ -
ent medications to which she didn’t respond.

She then consulted a surgeon who wanted to operate on
her valve.

Looking for another opinion, she came to see me.

I asked if she was on hormones.

When
she said “yes,” I figured she was hypersensitive because of medroxyprogesterone, which is known
to cause coronary artery constriction.

The resulting blood pressure increase was likely affecting
her mitral valve, resulting in significant mitral regurgitation.

I took her off the hormonal drugs,
and she normalized.

It was a dramatic eye-opener for me.

If a woman desires hormonal therapy,
she should only consider natural, bioidentical estrogen and progesterone under the supervision of a
knowledgeable doctor.

In Chapter 13, Dr. Pam Smith discusses this subject in great detail.

In younger women, hypertension may be as much as three times more common among
individuals taking oral contraceptives.

For such a hypertensive person, stopping “the pill” may
reduce systolic pressure by 15 points within 6 months.9 When a woman does become pregnant,
hypertension occurs in about 6%–8% of cases11 and can increase the risk of maternal and fetal
mortality.

Many women with high blood pressure deliver healthy babies (high blood pressure dur -
ing pregnancy is called eclampsia).

But pregnancy—and the increased blood volume required to
nurture a growing fetus—can potentially raise blood pressure to extremely high levels.

For this
reason, expectant mothers also should have blood pressure readings taken routinely.

Hypertension
can develop rapidly in the last 3 months of pregnancy.

When this happens, a woman may need
treatment, even after delivery.

Stress and hypertension have been traditionally associated with men, but that’s clearly an obso -
lete concept.

Just ask any working mom, as an example.

In my book,4 I reported on a 40-year-old
attorney who had a heart attack after divorcing her husband and moving out of state with her two
young children to be close to her parents, one of who had Alzheimer’s disease.

Clearly, that’s a
classic formula for stress, high blood pressure, and heart problems.

With good medical care, the
woman survived her MI and later came to see me about dealing with lifestyle and stress issues.

Summing up the situation, the authors of the journal article said that prevention of cardiovas -
cular events by blood pressure control is “30–100 percent higher in women than in men” and that
a 15-point increase in systolic blood pressure raises the risk of CVD by 56% in women compared
with 32% in men.10 Those two statistics make it quite clear that a woman needs to pay attention to
her blood pressure and do something about it if it is higher; further, if a woman does have any blood
pressure issues, she must be cautious about the routine use of over-the-counter analgesics.

A 2005 study looked at nonnarcotic analgesics and the risk of incident hypertension in U.S.
women.12 The study found that women aged 51–77 years who took an average daily dose of more
than 500 mg of acetaminophen or one Extra Strength Tylenol had about double the risk of develop -
ing high blood pressure in 3 years.

Women in the same age range who took more than 400 mg of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), equal to about two ibuprofen, had a 78% risk of
developing high blood pressure over those who did not take any nonsteroidals.

Younger women,
aged 34–53 years, who took an average of 500 mg of acetaminophen a day had a twofold higher risk
of developing high blood pressure.

Similar aged women who took 400 mg of NSAIDs had a 60%
risk increase over those who did not take the meds.

The study also demonstrated that aspirin did 330 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
not increase these risks.

The study also demonstrated that aspirin did 330 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
not increase these risks.

The study involved 5123 women participating in the Nurse’s Health Study
at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.12 Although none of the
women had high blood pressure when the study began, higher doses of acetaminophen and NSAIDs
independently increased the risk of hypertension in these women.

Although NSAIDs increase renal
sodium absorption, both acetaminophen and NSAIDs may impair endothelial function, which may
explain why blood pressure increases.

Because the results of this study have confirmed previous
investigations, it makes sense to educate women about the overzealous use of these analgesics.

If you take painkillers regularly, be sure to inform your doctor and find out about safer medica -
tions.

I recommend Traumeel, a homeopathic remedy available in health food stores or online at
www.traumeel.com.

You can buy it as a topical cream or sublingual tablet, and it works great for
various muscle aches and pains, without potentially devastating effects on blood pressure as optimal
blood pressure control is essential for women in helping to prevent DD.

Women with high blood pressure are much more prone to DD, a condition involving progressive
stiffening of the heart muscle that weakens the left ventricle’s pumping ability.

It can lead to the
most common and serious form of heart failure that affects women.

Shortness of breath in a hyper -
tensive woman frequently suggests that she has DD and because standard medicine has no effective
treatment over time DD may progress to diastolic heart failure.

DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE
Diastolic heart failure is the accumulation of fluid in the body resulting from compliance issues
of the left ventricle or a “stiffening of the heart muscle.” When the myocardium does not relax
fully, the cavity inside the heart remains compromised and is unable to fill properly.

In essence,
during diastole the filling cycle struggles.

Therefore, patients may feel shortness of breath and may
complain of chest pain, fatigue, and even leg swelling.

Their symptoms and physical findings are
similar with patients with systolic heart failure caused by a weakened heart13 (often referred to as
heart failure with impaired systolic function), and their prognosis in most cases is poor.13,14 The mor -
bidity and mortality caused by diastolic heart failure, again, often referred to as heart failure with
well-preserved systolic function, is very similar to systolic heart failure.

The estimated health-care
cost is $30 billion dollars in the United States for 2010.15 Thus, diastolic heart failure and systolic
dysfunction places a great burden on the health-care system in the United States.

The identification of effective treatments for diastolic heart failure remains an important area
of concern given the predominance of women with diastolic heart failure,16 lack of specific thera -
pies,17,18 and high mortality and morbidity associated with this affliction.13,14 The scope of this heart
failure epidemic was projected for those over 40 years to be 20%, a level well in excess of many
conditions associated with aging.19
The treatment for diastolic heart failure remains severely limited as pharmaceutical drugs have
been shown to be of little benefit based on randomized clinical studies.20 The Women’s Health
Coalition Report20 also lamented on the lack of effective treatments for DD  and indicated that the
prognosis has not changed over the last 15 years.

Clearly, an alternative to standard pharmaceutical
intervention is needed.

Clearly, an alternative to standard pharmaceutical
intervention is needed.

We must, therefore, look to cardiac energetics and metabolic support with a focus on  adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) and energy substrates in mitochondria.21 Because biopsies of heart tissue in
heart failure patients reveal diminished quantities of ATP in the mitochondria,22 investigating thera -
pies that promote the basis of cellular metabolism must be utilized.

Myocytes contain the highest
concentrations of mitochondria cellular constituents necessary to generate the huge amounts of
ATP required to fuel the high-energy demand of cardiac energetics.21,23
The energetic imbalance of heart failure is characterized by an increase in energy demand and
a decrease in energy production, transfer, and substrate utilization resulting in an ATP deficit.

DD is the result of the heart muscle’s inability to relax sufficiently after contraction because it
cannot maintain the higher concentrations of ATP required to effectively activate the calcium 331 Women and Heart Disease
pumps necessary to facilitate cardiac relaxation and diastolic filling.21,23,24 All patients with heart
failure have DD to some degree.

Similar energetic adaptations occur in the atrium, which may
contribute to atrial fibrillation.25
Because the requirements of myocytes for ATP is absolute,23 incorporating a metabolic approach
with nutritional biochemical interventions that preserve and promote mitochondrial support and
ATP production must be considered.

For example, in a randomized controlled trial 300 mg of coen -
zyme Q10 reduced plasma pyruvate/lactate ratios and improved endothelial function via  reversal
of mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with ischemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction.26 Such
a metabolic cardiology approach does not create adverse effects and may be supportive in patients
with DD.

Patients prone to DD such as the aging population as described in a recent Journal of the
American Medical Association  study27 may also need metabolic support.

An effective solution for failing ATP production involves nutraceutical support with coenzyme
Q10, L-carnitine, magnesium, and D-ribose.21,24 Supplied on a daily basis, they provide essential
raw materials that support cellular energy substrates needed by mitochondria to rebuild feeble
ATP levels.

Such treatment options that incorporate metabolic interventions targeted to preserve
ATP energy substrates (D-ribose) or accelerate ATP turnover (L-carnitine and coenzyme Q10) are
indicated for at-risk populations and patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery.

This metabolic
cardiology approach does not create adverse effects and may be supportive in preventing atrial
fibrillation often seen in patients with DD after undergoing cardiac surgery28 as well as in patients
with hypertension and MVP where DD is also frequently seen.

MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE
MVP is a relatively benign condition of the mitral valve (which lies between the left atrium and the
left ventricle and is shaped like a bishop’s hat or miter).

Sometimes, the mitral valve leaflets become
thickened, voluminous, or stretched, which may cause a slight to severe leakage of the valve.

Many
times on physical examination, a mid to late systolic click may be heard followed by a murmur
or leak.

While most patients don’t even know they have MVP, a few are particularly bothered by
somatic symptoms (from chest discomforts to irregular heartbeats and even shortness of breath).

In the rare cases, surgery may be considered if spontaneous rupture of the chordae tendinae occurs
resulting in a severe left ventricular overload state with mitral regurgitation and left ventricular
failure.

During my cardiovascular fellowship, I studied under Dr. Robert Jeresaty, the author of the book
Mitral Valve Prolapse .29 As his senior cardiovascular fellow, I participated in gathering data for him
on over 300 patients in our MVP clinic.

I did dozens of phonocardiograms in which a graphic display
of mid and late systolic clicks followed by frequent late systolic murmurs was recorded.

Recording
the data and examining many patients, I realized that MVP, fortunately, was terribly symptomatic
for only a very few patients.

However, one especially bothersome symptom was shortness of breath,
which was difficult to evaluate.

Although arrhythmias and chest pain and documentation of clicks
and murmurs were relatively straightforward, the shortness of breath was perplexing.

Therefore, we
decided to study 20 patients with MVP with pulmonary function studies.

All these patients were nonsmokers, and chest radiographs were obtained to document structural
thoracic wall deformities, which were present in several of the patients.

The lack of any significant
correlation between shortness of breath and either pulmonary function abnormalities or chest wall
deformity suggested that the symptoms of dyspnea may be nonpulmonary in origin.30 Although
decreased left ventricular compliance seen in the prolapse of the mitral valve was one possible
mechanism,31 none of the authors (myself included) were privy to the nature of DD, which has
been a relatively new correlation in the last two decades.

We published the paper in July of 1979.30
Looking back, these patients most likely had DD, but we were not aware of this pathologic abnor -
mality as it took about another 20 years to diagnose DD via echocardiographic analysis using tissue
Doppler to assess mitral valve velocities.32332 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Unfortunately, the therapeutic treatment in these patients, and particularly in those with severe
shortness of breath, was limited with β-blockers, which was the only treatment we had to offer.

β-Blockers were particularly effective in the treatment of arrhythmia and atypical chest pain; how -
ever, it was fruitless in most of the cases with shortness of breath.

After I understood the phenome -
non of DD many years later, I realized why these patients experienced shortness of breath.

Metabolic
cardiology has been the most effective treatment in patients with MVP and especially in those with
shortness of breath and fatigue.

The conventional literature attests to the efficacy of magnesium.

Magnesium has shown efficacy in relieving symptoms of MVP.

In a double-blind study of 181
participants,33 80 serum magnesium levels were assessed in 141 patients with symptomatic MVP
and compared to those of 40 healthy control subjects.

While decreased serum magnesium levels
were found in more than half (60% to be exact) of the patients with MVP, only 5% of the con -
trol subjects showed similar decreases.

The second phase of the study investigated response to
treatment.

Participants with magnesium deficits were randomly assigned to receive magnesium supple -
ment or placebo, and results for the magnesium group were dramatic.

The mean (average) number
of symptoms per patient was significantly reduced with magnesium supplementation; significant
reductions were noted in weakness, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, and even anxiety.

Decreases in the amount of adrenalin-like substances in the urine were noted as well.

The research -
ers made two conclusions.

First, many patients with MVP with severe symptoms do have low serum magnesium levels.

Second, supplementation with the crucial mineral leads to an improvement in symptoms and a
decrease in adrenalin-like hormones.33 For these individuals, magnesium supplementation may be
the solution for reducing symptomatology while improving quality of life at the same time.

In my experience, the combination of 400 mg of magnesium in a combined form of citrate,
glycinate, turinate, and orotate and 100–200 mg of coenzyme Q10 has been extremely promising.

In my experience, the combination of 400 mg of magnesium in a combined form of citrate,
glycinate, turinate, and orotate and 100–200 mg of coenzyme Q10 has been extremely promising.

I’ve seen that it alleviates 80%–90% of symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, easy
fatigability, and palpitations.

The enhanced quality of life most likely was due to some improvement
in DD, which is frequently seen on echocardiographic analysis in women with MVP.

On occasion, a
full metabolic prescription was required with the addition of 5 g of D-ribose and 1 g of L-carnitine
twice a day in symptomatic patients with MVP with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

This
similar metabolic approach is also extremely therapeutic in PAD.

PAD is another significant clinical
problem for women.

PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE
Peripheral artery disease (PAD)  is the third leading cause of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular
morbidity followed by coronary artery disease and stroke.

In a broad-based review of the literature
involving 34 studies worldwide,34 PAD has become a global problem involving over 200 million
people, with smoking, diabetes, and hypertension being the prevalent risk factors.34
Arterial disease (atherosclerosis) is never limited to the coronary arteries.

If you have it in one
place, you likely have it elsewhere.

PAD refers to atherosclerotic disease in the arteries of your
lower legs.

PAD has received scant public recognition and it has always been considered a man’s disease.

In
my practice, I saw many more men than women with PAD symptoms, most typically cramping and
pain in the calves when walking (called intermittent claudication).

Women don’t seem to develop
those symptoms as often unless they are smokers.

They usually complain more of fatigue and func -
tional decline in the legs.

But the following revelations from a recent American Heart Association
“call to action” article published in the journal Circulation35 clearly illustrates how prevalent and
serious a problem of PAD appears to be for women.

PAD increases with age for both men and women, yet evidence suggests that over 40 years of
age more women than men are affected.333 Women and Heart Disease
PAD is so common that it has equal morbidity and mortality and perhaps even higher medical
costs than coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke.

The gender associations between PAD and
cardiovascular events and mortality are not well defined; however, population-based studies suggest
a higher trend among women.

The summary statements by the authors indicate the following35:
• Most women with PAD, like men, do not have classic symptoms of intermittent
clau   d     ication.

• Women with PAD have greater functional impairment and a more rapid functional decline
than women without PAD.

• Women (and particularly black females) are more likely than men to experience graft
failure or limb loss.

• There is a need to identify women with or at risk for PAD, especially black women, to
lower cardiovascular ischemic event rates, loss of independent functional capacity, and
ischemic amputation rates.

• Women in the United States attend as many or more PAD physician visits as men, which
confirms the very large burden of PAD in women.

• Women predominantly see doctors and other clinicians for PAD in the outpatient office
setting.

The risks associated with PAD are not fully recognized by clinicians and governmental agencies
and certainly not the public.

The evaluation of PAD is tedious and complex, involving a meticulous
evaluation of peripheral pulses, targeted blood pressure measurements involving brachial and tibial
arteries, duplex ultrasound, as well as advanced imaging studies in some patients.

373,"Chunk 373:
Although many
successful treatments frequently involve pharmaceutical and surgical procedures including arte -
rial stents, many patients without major obstructions to blood vessels continue to be symptomatic
despite conventional methodologies.

Frequently, small vessel disease is present and a metabolic
approach is warranted.

My metabolic cardiology recommendations for women include the following targeted nutritional
supplement program for PAD support:
• A high-quality multimineral/vitamin formula.

• A total of 100–300 mg of coenzyme Q10 and 200–600 mg of magnesium, both of which
help to lower blood pressure and support endothelial function.

• A total of 1–3 g of broad-spectrum L-carnitine or 2 g of glycine propionyl L-carnitine
(GPLC), a proprietary form of L-carnitine.

L-carnitine helps clear out metabolic wastes
that aggravate vasoconstriction in small blood vessels generated by cellular energy
production.

Cellular efficiency and aerobic capacity are supported when toxic by-products
or the β oxidation of fats are shuttled out of the mitochondria.

GPLC does the same and
also helps to improve blood flow by boosting nitric oxide, a biochemical that keeps blood
vessels relaxed.

• A total of 5 g D-ribose, three times daily.

• A total of 1 to 2 g ω-3 fatty acid (fish or squid oil).

Another simple and therapeutic intervention for diffuse distal vessel disease is earthing.

Earthing,
where you reconnect with the Earth’s healing energy by being barefoot outdoors or sleeping, working,
or relaxing indoors on earthing sheets or mats, in my opinion, is yet another simple and therapeutic
intervention for diffuse distal vessel disease.

Earthing generates healing  benefits such as improved
blood viscosity and ζ potential,36 reduced inflammation, decreased pain, lower blood pressure, a calm -
ing effect on the nervous system with a downregulation of heightened sympathetic tone with improved
heart rate variability,37 better sleep, and more energy—all positives for supporting vascular pathology.334 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
To summarize, the recognition and treatment of PAD is a widespread problem that is frequently
undiagnosed and mismanaged.

Remember that arteriosclerotic CVD is a diffuse process and when
plaquing shows up in one area of the body it is most likely present in other areas as well.

So, the
diagnosis of PAD could literally tip off the physician that other areas of the body such as the carotid
and coronary arteries are most likely involved as well.

Although PAD was not considered to be a
major pathology in women, it clearly has become a major problem afflicting women and especially
African-American women.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Women are vastly different than men.

In the coronary circulation for example, their arteries are
smaller and more difficult to navigate with stents and even bypass grafting and this is probably why
they have an increased mortality following acute MI, stent, and coronary artery bypass surgery
interventions.

They are also exposed to a number of life circumstances that influence classical
cardiovascular risk factors.

For example, in younger women oral contraceptives may elevate blood
pressure slightly.

However, in women with a family history of hypertension oral contraceptives
may be a most aggregating factor in raising the numbers.

Pregnancy is also another consider -
ation in which increased blood volume required to nurture a growing fetus can potentially raise
blood pressure to high levels.

Menopause with age-related hormonal declines can cause a woman’s
arteries to become less elastic and more constrictive, thus contributing to inflammation as well
as higher blood pressure.

Coronary artery disease goes up significantly when a woman approaches
menopausal years.

374,"Chunk 374:
Coronary artery disease goes up significantly when a woman approaches
menopausal years.

Metabolic syndrome is another area where women need to be aggressively treated as women
with type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance with higher triglyceride levels have more risk as opposed
to men.

DD, which is more prevalent in women with hypertension and occurring in MVP, frequently
found in more women than men, is another area of marked concern given the fact that conventional
medicine has very few options to offer.

Even painkillers in women can have a detrimental effect on their health.

Acetaminophen,
ibuprofen, and aspirin are three of the most frequently used drugs by both women and men.

Prospective cohort studies among older women and even younger women demonstrate that higher
doses of acetaminophen and NSAIDs independently increase the risk of hypertension in women.

The high prevalence rate of hypertension in the United States may be related to the overzealous use
of acetaminophen and NSAIDs.

In the final analysis, a gender-specific approach, although increasing in popularity, has not
always been to the advantage of women.

As previously mentioned, there are several  considerations
and concerns that are germane to women.

Again, aside from smoking cessation, hypertension
management is the single most important intervention to reduce the risk of future  cardiovascular
events.

However, the diagnosis and management of hypertension and its  relationship to DD  warrants
the need for a gender-specific focus as more aggressive diagnosis and treatment  methodologies
are required more for women.

Another area of concern is the routine use of statin drugs in women,
which was discussed in Chapter 3.

Remember, women have more side effects as opposed to their
male counterparts and the therapeutic efficacy in women is much weaker as opposed to men.

CVD is the major leading cause of death in women today.

Conducting appropriate gender-specific
differences research and analysis of CVD trials has been difficult due to insufficient recruitment
of women.

Although this has contributed to a lack of understanding of gender differences in CVD,
improved participation rates of women in new cardiovascular trials would yield more information
concerning appropriate prevention, detection, accurate diagnosis, as well as proper treatment of
all women with heart disease.

In the near future, gender-specific medicine will probably be able to
stand on its own and physicians will have a better understanding in the diagnosis and treatment of
women with CVD.335 Women and Heart Disease

15Hormones and Their Effects
on the Cardiovascular System
Pamela Smith
HORMONES AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR
SYSTEM IN WOMEN
Hormones in women have a major impact on the cardiovascular system.

Much has been dis -
cussed in the medical literature concerning insulin and its effects on the cardiovascular system.

There are other hormones, however, that also play a major role in women’s heart health such as
estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), cortisol, thyroid hormone,
melatonin, and pregnenolone.

These hormones all interact with each other in the body.

They are
like a symphony.

Consequently, if one hormone is playing out of tune all of the hormones will be
affected.

Consequently, when estrogen levels start to decline
women can develop many symptoms.

The following are signs and symptoms of estrogen deficiency:71
• Acne/oily skin
• Anxiety
• Arthritis
• Brittle hair and nails
• Fatigue/low energy especially at the end of the day
• Cognitive decline
• Decreased breast size
• Decrease in dexterity
• Decrease in sexual interest and function
• Depression
• Stress incontinence
• Insulin resistance
• Difficulty losing weight even with diet and exercise
• Dry eyes
• Hypertension
• Hypercholesterolemia
• Hypertriglyceridemia
• Food cravings
• Increase in facial hair
• Increase in tension headaches/migraines
• Infertility
• Joint pain
• Increased risk of developing heart disease and strokes
• More wrinkles/aging skin
• Osteoporosis/osteopenia
• Panic attacks
• High testosterone levels
• Insomnia/restless sleep
• Thinning skin
• Thinning hair
• Urinary tract infections
• Vaginal dryness
• Vulvodynia
• Weight gain
Epidemiological studies have shown that estrogen replacement therapy may reduce the risk of
heart disease by 50% in postmenopausal women.4–6 Furthermore, studies have shown a 40%–50%
reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with hormone replacement therapy.7 Menopause,
whether it is natural or surgical, is commonly associated with a change in lipid profile that is not
desirous:
• Elevation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL).

• Higher total cholesterol.

• Triglyceride levels rise.

• Lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL).

• LDL to HDL ratio may move to a nonfavorable value even if the total cholesterol level does
not change.339 Hormones and Their Effects on the Cardiovascular System
Estrogen replacement helps to normalize the lipid profile8,9:
• Decreases total cholesterol
• Lowers LDL
• Raises HDL
• Increases large very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles
• Lowers remnant VLDL levels
Furthermore, another study showed that triglycerides improved in women who used transdermal
(applied to the skin) estrogen.12 Estrogen replacement therapy also positively affects other cardio -
vascular risk factors.

Research has shown that patients who have an elevated lipoprotein(a) have
a 70% higher rate of developing heart disease over 10 years.10,187,196,197 Lipoprotein(a) levels are
decreased by estrogen replacement therapy by up to 15%.11
There are many mechanisms by which medical studies have shown that estrogen replacement
therapy is cardioprotective, besides estrogen’s positive effects on lipid studies.

There are even estro -
gen and progesterone receptor sites on the atrial and ventricular fiber level of the heart.25
• Estrogen may improve arterial function independent of lipid effects.13
• Estrogen stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in vascular endothelial cells.14
• Estrogen enhances endothelial dependent vasodilation mediated by nitric oxide.15
• Estrogen has effects on posttranscriptional and translation modulation of proteins and
enzymes.16–19
• Estrogen has positive effects on the mitochondria.20–22
• Estrogen suppresses reactive oxygen species through other mechanisms than the
mitochondria.23,24
• The most prominent effects of estrogen on vascular reactivity are through its ability to
influence endothelial function.26
• Estrogen promotes vasodilation through an eNOS-dependent mechanism.

• Estrogen increases flow-mediated vasodilation.27
• Estrogen affects production of other endothelial factors.28
• Estrogen increases the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors in postmenopausal
women.29
• Estrogen stimulates muscarinic and β-adrenergic cardiac receptors.30
• Estradiol decreases arterial impedance in the carotid and uterine arteries in postmeno -
pausal women.31
• Estrogen increases left ventricular systolic flow measurements, which increase stroke
volume, and helps to preserve myocardial contractility.32
• Estrogen is a calcium channel blocker.

• Estrogen affects the regulation of intracellular calcium.

its effects on catecholamine reuptake at the synaptic cleft, has genomic regulation
of α-adrenergic receptors, and competes with norepinephrine for adrenergic binding
sites.51,52
• Women on estrogen replacement therapy have been shown to have coronary calcification

• Estrogen applied transdermally has an anti-inflammatory effect.56–58
• Estradiol improves insulin sensitivity in women with coronary heart disease.59
• Estrogen lowers fibrinogen levels.60
• Estrogen reduces infiltration of leukocytes to arteries after endothelium denudation and
cytokine-induced gene transcription in smooth muscle.112,113
There is much less information on estrogen’s effects on veins than on arteries.

Studies suggest
that the presence of ovarian hormones affects endothelial production of inhibitory prostanoids in
veins just as it does in arteries.46
Estrogen has been shown to also affect blood pressure.

The depletion of estrogen with a rise in
androgens in women at menopause reduces local inhibitory signals while elevating  procontractile
signals at the vascular wall.

This leads to increased peripheral resistance and blood pressure in the
absence of a decrease in sympathetic tone.

In addition, estrogen depletion elevates  sympathetic
tone and circulating levels of norepinephrine, which result in an elevation of blood pressure
especially if the person is under stress.105 Estrogen depletion is also associated with withdrawal
of inhibitory tone (such as imparted by the parasympathetic system), which increases peripheral
resistance and lowers heart rate variability.

Studies have shown that estrogen replacement has
positive effects on blood pressure by several different mechanisms.

Estrogen replacement has been
shown to restore heart rate variability.106 In addition, studies have shown that estrogen decreases
serum  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity by 20%.47,48 Furthermore, estrogen inhibits
the renin–angiotensin system by reducing the transcription of ACE in endothelial cells.49 Estrogen
also upregulates endothelium-derived vasodilator factors with simultaneous downregulation of
vasoconstrictor factors like endothelin-1.50,114 Likewise, estrogen replacement ameliorates the
problems with sympathetic tone.

In review of the studies presented here, estrogen replacement therapy has many beneficial effects
on the cardiovascular system.

The timing of estrogen replacement is important for both cardiovas -
cular health and memory maintenance.

The ability for estrogen replacement therapy to prevent or
slow the progression of vascular remodeling or plaque formation may be somewhat limited if not
begun at the time of menopause.

This same concept holds true for the actions of estrogen on the
mitochondria.

This same concept holds true for the actions of estrogen on the
mitochondria.

It is still important to replace estrogen in menopausal women who have low levels;
however, the more positive effects on cardiovascular disease occur if estrogen is replaced as soon as
the patient becomes deficient.

Estrogen for hormone replacement therapy should always be prescribed transdermally and
should include both estradiol and estriol because both hormones have a positive effect on the heart.

This combination is called biest.

Oral estrogen should not be considered as it is proinflammatory.

This is due to the fact that hepatic metabolism of17 β-estradiol produces proinflammatory metabo -
lites in higher concentrations if given orally as opposed to the transdermal application of estro -
gen,107 whereas transdermal application of estrogen has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory
effect.108–111 In addition, estrogen replacement transdermally has been shown to lower interleukin
(IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α, and IL-1.114 There are other negative reasons why estrogen
should not be prescribed orally as hormone replacement.

Estrogen by mouth can cause any of the
following115:
• Increases blood pressure
• Increases triglycerides341 Hormones and Their Effects on the Cardiovascular System
• Increases estrone (the estrogen that should not be replaced because it is the estrogen that
is linked to breast cancer)
• Gallstones
• Elevates liver enzymes
• Increases sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) (which decreases bioavailable testoster -
one levels)
• Interrupts tryptophan metabolism and consequently serotonin metabolism
• May lower growth hormone
• Increases C-reactive protein (CRP)
• Increases carbohydrate cravings
• Increases prothrombic effects
Transdermally applied, estradiol has been shown not to increase the risk of developing a car -
diovascular accident (CVA).116 Other studies showed no risk with transdermal estradiol use in the
development of thrombolism.117,118 In the future, intravenous (IV) estrogen may be used to treat heart
attacks and heart rhythms that are not regular.61
When prescribing estrogen, progesterone should also be given even in women who have had a
total hysterectomy.

Again, the hormones in the body are a symphony so that balance between the
hormones is paramount.

In addition, prescribed hormones should always be in the natural form,
also called bioidentical form.

In medicine, the word natural means that the hormone is of the same
chemical structure that God gave the patient.

The word synthetic denotes that the chemical structure
is not the same one that the individual is born with.

Furthermore, natural does not technically have
to do with the derivation of the drug.

In this case, however, natural hormones that are prescribed are
derived from yams or soy.

Progesterone
Progesterone levels can be low at any age.

Women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS), postpartum
depression, and women who are peri-and postmenopausal are all commonly low in progesterone.

Other causes of low progesterone in women include high sugar intake; deficiency of vitamins A, B6,
and C; deficiency of zinc; hypothyroidism; high intake of saturated fat; stress; antidepressant use;
and high prolactin levels.198–202 Signs and symptoms of progesterone loss include the following71:
• Anxiety
• Depression
• Irritability
• Mood swings
• Insomnia
• Pain and inflammation
• Osteoporosis/osteopenia
• Excessive menstruation
• Hypersensitivity
• Nervousness
• Migraine headaches related to menstrual cycle
• Weight gain
• Decreased libido
• Decreased HDL
• High LDL
• Incontinence
• Palpitations342 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Natural progesterone is very different from synthetic progestins.

Progestins do not balance estro -
gen, and they interfere with the body’s own production of progesterone.

Progestins do not balance estro -
gen, and they interfere with the body’s own production of progesterone.

Progestins may also be
associated with any of the following203–205:
• Increased appetite203
• Weight gain203
• Fluid retention
• Irritability
• Depression
• Headache
• Decreased energy
• Bloating
• Breast tenderness
• Decreased sexual interest
• Acne
• Hair loss
• Nausea
• Insomnia
• May increase the symptoms of progesterone loss
• Protects only the uterus and not the breast from cancer173
• Counteracts many of the positive effects of estrogen on serotonin209
Likewise, progesterone and progestins have different effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation
and hence on the risk of developing heart disease.

Progesterone inhibits smooth muscle cell prolifer -
ation, and progestins may increase proliferation of heart artery smooth muscle cells.62 Furthermore,
progesterone inhibits vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression, which helps to prevent heart
disease, and progestins do not inhibit vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.63 In addition, progestins
can raise LDL and lower HDL.

Lastly, progestins can cause spasm of the coronary arteries.205
Likewise, in postmenopausal women progesterone, and not progestin, enhances the beneficial effect
that estrogen has on exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.64 Very importantly, progestins can stop
the protective effects that estrogen has on the heart.205–208 In contrast, natural progesterone increases
the beneficial effects that estrogen has on blood vessels.212–214
Natural progesterone, unlike synthetic progestins, has the following other positive effects on a
women’s body210:
• Helps balance estrogen
• Lowers blood pressure65
• Leaves the body quickly211
• Improves sleep
• Has a natural calming affect
• Helps the body use and eliminate fats
• Lowers cholesterol
• May protect against breast cancer as it has an antiproliferative effect215,216
• Increases scalp hair
• Helps balance fluids in the cells
• Increases metabolic rate217
• Is a natural diuretic
• Is a natural antidepressant
• Is anti-inflammatory
• Stimulates the production of new bone
• Enhances the action of thyroid hormones343 Hormones and Their Effects on the Cardiovascular System
• Improves libido
• Helps restore proper cell oxygen levels
• Induces conversion of E1 to the inactive E1S form
• Promotes Th2 immunity
• Is neuroprotective/promotes myelination
For all of the aforementioned reasons, when prescribing progesterone the natural form progester -
one and not the synthetic form progestin should be employed.

testosterone
Testosterone in women is made in the adrenal glands and ovaries.

Women can have low testosterone
levels at any age due to stress, medications, chemotherapy, childbirth, depression, endometriosis,
and menopause.

Signs and symptoms of testosterone deficiency include the following71:
• Anxiety
• Decline in muscle tone/muscle wasting despite adequate calorie and protein intake
• Decreased HDL
• Decreased sex drive
• Droopy eyelids
• Dry, thin skin with poor elasticity
• Dry, thinning hair
• Fatigue
• Hypersensitive, hyperemotional states
• Less dreaming
• Loss of pubic hair
• Low self-esteem
• Mild depression
• Saggy cheeks
• Thin lips
• Weight gain
Testosterone replacement in women who are deficient has been shown to relax coronary arter -
ies and allow more blood to flow to the heart.

It has also been shown to decrease symptoms of
angina.66–68 In another medical trial, testosterone replacement in postmenopausal women was found
to lower lipoprotein(a) levels by up to 65%.69 Testosterone can be increased in other ways besides
hormone replacement: exercise; decreasing calorie intake; getting enough sleep; increasing the
amount of protein in the diet; weight loss if the patient is overweight; stress reduction; taking the
amino acids arginine, leucine, or glutamine; and zinc supplementation (if the patient is deficient, as
zinc aids in the metabolization of testosterone).

Testosterone is only replaced in women who have their own estrogen or who are already receiv -
ing estrogen replacement.

If the estrogen level is low and testosterone is replaced, it increases the
patient’s risk of heart disease if estrogen is not also supplemented.

As discussed earlier, if estrogen
is being prescribed then progesterone is always given as well.

Just like any other hormone in the body, too high or too low levels of testosterone are not desir -
ous.

High testosterone levels can occur in women who have polycystic ovarian disease (polycystic
ovary syndrome [PCOS]) or in some women after menopause.70,71 Individuals with elevated testos -
terone levels have an increased risk for the following major diseases:
• Diabetes77
• Heart disease78344 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
• Hypertension79
• Infertility80
• Hormonally related cancers (breast, ovarian, and uterine)81,82
• Obesity83
Women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing heart disease compared to women with -
out PCOS.119–121 Up to 70% of women in the United States with PCOS have dyslipidemias.94,122–126
In addition, elevated testosterone levels in women can lower HDL.127 Furthermore, homocysteine
levels are commonly increased in patients with PCOS.128 Women with PCOS tend to have a higher
than usual rate of elevated CRP.

Also, women with PCOS frequently have decreased total antioxi -
dant status and increased oxidative stress.

These patterns may be some of the contributing causes of
an increased risk in the development of coronary artery disease in women with polycystic ovarian
disease.130 Women with PCOS also have four times the rate of hypertension than women who do not
have PCOS.131 Furthermore, because women with PCOS tend to have insulin resistance, their insu -
lin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may be associated with elevated blood pressure.132 In addition,
studies have shown that women with PCOS store fat better and burn calories at a slower rate than
women who do not have this disease process.133–135
PCOS affects almost 10% of women in the United States.

The following are signs and symptoms
of PCOS or high testosterone levels at menopause72,86–88,93–98:
• Obesity/inability to lose weight easily
• High testosterone
• Irregular or absent menstrual cycles
• Infertility or recurrent miscarriages
• Hirsutism
• Alopecia
• Oily skin and/or acne
• Acrochordons (skin tags)
• Depression/irritability/tension
• Acanthosis nigricans
• Gray–white breast discharge
• Sleep apnea
• Pelvic pain
• Thinning scalp hair
• Insulin resistance
• Hypertension
• Decreased SHBG
• High estrone
• Elevated DHEA levels
• Abnormal lipid levels
• Ovarian cysts
• Low progesterone levels
Some scientists believe that PCOS has a hereditary component.73,74 It is noted that 40% of women
with PCOS have a sister with PCOS.

Further, 35% of women with PCOS have a mother with
PCOS.89 There is a suggestion in the medical literature that women with PCOS are born with a gene
that triggers higher than normal levels of androgens or insulin.90,91 Studies have also shown that the
high levels of testosterone and insulin in patients with PCOS are lined by a gene called follistatin .

Follistatin  plays a role in the development of ovaries and is needed to make insulin.92 Furthermore,
phthalates, bisphenol A, cadmium, and mercury toxicities may be related to the development of
PCOS because they are endocrine disrupters.94345 Hormones and Their Effects on the Cardiovascular System
Stress may be a contributing factor to PCOS.75 Studies have shown that many women with PCOS
cannot process cortisol effectively, which can lead to elevated cortisol levels in the body.

High
cortisol levels may increase the risk of weight gain, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar and
blood pressure, thus increasing the individual’s risk of development of heart disease.76 Likewise,
hypothyroidism may be a cause of PCOS.

A study conducted on teenage women with hypothyroid -
ism showed that on ultrasound the ovarian cysts resolved when their hypothyroidism was treated.99
The full range of treatment of PCOS conventionally and from a metabolic approach is beyond
the scope of this chapter.

In considering the lowering of testosterone levels, the following therapies
have been proved to be successful: saw palmetto 240–260 mg twice a day or metformin 250–500 mg
daily, or spironolactone 100 mg twice a day.

deHydroeP iandrosterone
The majority of DHEA is made by the adrenal glands, but a small amount is made in the brain
and skin.

DHEA production declines with age.

A study of postmenopausal women with coronary
risk factors undergoing coronary angiography for suspected myocardial ischemia showed that lower
DHEA-S levels were linked with higher cardiovascular mortality and mortality due to any cause.84
Likewise, DHEA replacement has been shown to lower triglycerides and increase insulin sensitivity.71
DHEA supplementation should not be considered in patients with a hormonally related cancer.

cortisol
Cortisol is the only hormone in the body that may rise with age.

Cortisol has many functions in the
body, one of which is to help the body deal with stress.

When the body is stressed, cortisol levels
elevate.

This can increase the risk of development of heart disease because high cortisol levels are
commonly associated with high blood sugar, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceri -
demia, insomnia, and weight gain.

Furthermore, if cortisol levels are consistently high it may affect
the conversion of T4 to T3, which may lead to hypothyroidism.

In addition, stress can lead to peri -
vascular coronary artery inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulable states such
as elevated fibrinogen; elevated von Willebrand factor; elevated homocysteine; and high activity
of factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, plasminogen, 2-antiplasmin, and plasminogen-activating factor.145 In
a medical trial called the INTERHEART study, psychosocial factors like stress were shown to be
more potent predictors of the incidence of heart attack than diabetes, smoking, hypertension, and
obesity.103
Furthermore, when the body stays in a constant state of stress it depletes the body of impor -
tant nutrients such as magnesium, potassium, B vitamins, vitamin C, and zinc, many of which are
needed to help the adrenal glands function optimally.

Melatonin
Melatonin has many functions in the body.

One of them is to be cardioprotective.

Melatonin is a
vasodilator and free radical scavenger and inhibits the oxidation of LDL-C.140 Melatonin levels
have been found to be lower in patients with coronary heart disease compared to healthy patients.

One study showed that melatonin levels in patients with coronary heart disease were only one-fifth
that of health controls.85 Low levels of this important hormone may cause an increase in nighttime
sympathetic activity, which elevates the risk of developing coronary heart disease.

Melatonin is a
suppressor of sympathetic activity at night.

Low levels of melatonin can also lead to elevated levels
of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which may damage vessel walls.

Melatonin is a

Low levels of melatonin can also lead to elevated levels
of epinephrine and norepinephrine, which may damage vessel walls.

Atherogenic uptake of LDL
is increased by higher levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine.85,136 Furthermore, patients who
developed adverse effects after acute myocardial infarction (MI) were shown to have lower noctur -
nal melatonin levels.230346 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
A medical trial found that melatonin supplementation inhibited platelet aggregation.137 Melatonin
can also be cardioprotective by reducing hypoxia and preventing reoxygenation-induced damage in
patients with cardiac ischemia and ischemic stroke.138,139 One study showed an inverse correlation
between melatonin levels and CRP levels after acute MI.141 Moreover, one trial showed that melato -
nin levels in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting are disrupted during the procedure
and for up to 48 hours after the procedure.

Consider supplementing these patients with melatonin.142
The MARIA study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial.

It
used IV melatonin in patients following an acute MI who were having angioplasty.

The results of IV
melatonin showed that it decreased CRP and IL-6.

It also attenuated tissue damage from reperfu -
sion and decreased V-tach and V-fib after reperfusion.

Melatonin supplementation also attenuated
cellular and molecular damage from ischemia.143 Interestingly, one animal study showed that mela -
tonin supplementation daily at middle age decreased abdominal fat and lowered plasma insulin to
youthful levels.144
There are several reasons why one may have low melatonin levels.

Alcohol and caffeine use
can lower melatonin.

Electromagnetic field exposure, some medications such as nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, and the use of tobacco can also lower melatonin levels.

Melatonin levels can
be measured by salivary testing and can be easily supplemented.

Many disease processes are associated with hypothyroidism, one of which is heart disease.150
Elevated CRP levels have been found to be related to hypothyroidism.148 Furthermore, homocyste -
ine levels are commonly elevated in hypothyroid patients.

The mean level of homocysteine in one
medical trial was 16.3 in patients who were hypothyroid.149 One study looked at the signs and symp -
toms of low T3 in patients with cardiovascular disease and found the following151:
• Bradycardia
• Dyslipidemia
• Endothelial dysfunction
• Narrowed pulse pressure
• Diastolic hypertension
• High CRP
• High homocysteine
Another study looked at T3 and cardiovascular disease.

The results of that trial showed that
cardiovascular disease may be associated with low T3 and that supplementation increased cardiac
contractility and decreased systemic vascular resistance.152 When looking specifically at conges -
tive heart failure and thyroid function, a low ratio of T3 to reverse T3 is a predictor of mortality
in patients with congestive heart failure.

IV T3 was given, and it increased cardiac output and
decreased systemic vascular resistance.

It was well tolerated.153–155 Another study showed that thy -
roid hormone dysfunction plays an important role in the progression to dilated heart failure.

It was well tolerated.153–155 Another study showed that thy -
roid hormone dysfunction plays an important role in the progression to dilated heart failure.

When
thyroid hormone replacement was given, the patients showed improvements in remodeling, includ -
ing beneficial changes in myocyte shape, microcirculation, and collagen.156 In another study using
IV T3 in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure, the heart rate was
decreased and improvement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was seen along with improvement
of ventricular performance.157 In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, one investigation
found that if they developed V-tach it was commonly associated with low T3 or low T3 to T4 ratio
and increased reverse T3.158
Thyroid function has also been evaluated in patients post coronary artery bypass grafting.

If the
patient had low T3, it was found to be predictive of an increased risk in the development of atrial
fibrillation after surgery.159 Low T3 was likewise shown in another study to be a strong predictor of
death in cardiac patients.160 Furthermore, when looking at reverse T3 levels elevated reverse T3 was
the strongest predictor of mortality in the first year after a patient had an acute MI.162 It is important
to be judicious about the starting of thyroid medication after an acute MI.

Thyroid replacement
has been proved to aid in remodeling after the event.

T3 supplementation was found to decrease
inflammatory cytokines along with adrenergic signaling, which causes beta-like myosin expres -
sion.

Thyroid supplementation in these patients also helped to normalize wall tension, and chamber
geometry was found to improve.163,164
Thyroid hormone replacement when it is optimized has been shown to do the following:165,166
• Improves lipid levels
• Improves congestive heart failure349 Hormones and Their Effects on the Cardiovascular System
• Is vasodilatory
• Is a positive inotrope
• Normalizes QT interval
• Improves CRP levels
• Improves homocysteine levels
• Improves arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction
• Prevents abnormal cardiac remodeling after acute MI and help with repair
• Improves insulin sensitivity
Furthermore, serum thyroid hormone levels may not accurately reflect thyroid tissue levels and
cardiac function in patients with mild hypothyroidism.167 Therefore, it is important to look at opti -
mal replacement along with factors that influence how thyroid hormones function.

The body makes
two active thyroid hormones: T3 and T4.

Factors that cause decreased production of T4 such as a deficiency of zinc; copper; and vitamins
A, B2, B3, and B6 should be replaced.

Sometimes the patient may just need to have a better eating
program and/or take a multivitamin to help their thyroid function optimally.

The body converts
T4 to the more active T3 form.

This conversion requires 5 ′-deiodinase production.

The body converts
T4 to the more active T3 form.

This conversion requires 5 ′-deiodinase production.

The following
elements negatively affect 5 ′-deiodinase production168–172:
• Selenium deficiency
• Cadmium, mercury, or lead toxicity
• Starvation
• Inadequate protein intake
• High carbohydrate diet
• Elevated cortisol levels/stress
• Chronic illness
• Decreased kidney or liver function
• Inflammation
Other factors can produce thyroid dysfunction by causing an inability to convert T4 to T3, which
include the following nutritional deficiencies173–175:
• Iodine
• Iron
• Selenium
• Zinc
• Vitamins A, B2, B6, and B12
Medications can also negatively affect the conversion of T4 to T3176–179:
• β-Blockers
• Oral contraceptives
• Estrogen replacement
• Lithium
• Phenytoin
• Theophylline
• Chemotherapy
• Clomipramine
• Glucocorticoids
• IL-6350 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
Even a diet that is not well balanced can affect the conversion of T4 to T3180:
• Too many cruciferous vegetables
• Low protein diet
• Low fat diet
• Low carbohydrate diet
• Excessive alcohol use
• Too many walnuts
• Excessive soy intake
In addition, the following entities can have an adverse effect on the conversion of T4 to T3181–183:
• Aging
• High α-lipoic acid supplementation (600 mg or more daily)
• Diabetes
• Fluoride
• Lead toxicity
• Mercury toxicity
• Pesticides
• Radiation
• Stress
• Surgery
• Copper excess
• Calcium excess
• Dioxins
• Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
• Inadequate production of DHEA and/or cortisol
• Phthalates
Furthermore, factors that are associated with low T3 or an increase in reverse T3 can affect thy -
roid function and increase the patient’s risk of developing heart disease184:
• Increased epinephrine or norepinephrine levels
• Free radical production
• Aging
• Fasting
• Stress
• Prolonged illness
• Diabetes
• Toxic metal exposure
• Elevated levels of IL-6, TNF- α, and interferon (IFN)-2
The following factors increase the conversion of T4 to T3.

Consequently, if the conversion is
low, it may be possible to fix the etiology of the problem or to increase supplementation to enhance
thyroid function185–188:
• Selenium
• Potassium
• Iodine
• Iron
• Zinc351 Hormones and Their Effects on the Cardiovascular System
• High protein diet
• Ashwaganda
• Vitamins A, B2, and E
• Growth hormone
• Testosterone (decreases the concentration of thyroid-binding globulin)
• Insulin
• Glucagon
• Melatonin
• Tyrosine
When ordering laboratory evaluations on a patient with expected hypothyroidism, it is para -
mount that an entire panel of studies is done:
• Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
• Free T3
• Free T4
• Reverse T3
• Thyroid antibodies (antithyroglobulin antibody, antimicrosomal antibody, and anti-TPO
antibody)
Studies have shown that most patients have greater improvement when prescribed both T3 and
T4 as thyroid replacement.189–192 T3 and T4 can be given separately or they can be delivered as a
combination drug such as desiccated thyroid.

Most desiccated thyroid medications are close to four
parts—T4 to one part T3.

If this ratio is not the perfect thyroid replacement for the patient, then
the practitioner can have the thyroid medication compounded.

As a compound, thyroid can be any
ratio that would be the perfect replacement for the patient’s individual needs.

It is also important
when prescribing thyroid medication that optimal ranges are used.

Studies have shown that a TSH
of 2.0–2.5 as the upper limit of normal provides for optimal function along with decreasing the
symptoms of hypothyroidism.193–195 In a study performed on postmenopausal women, women with
TSH levels in the upper reference range had increased arterial stiffness compared to women with
lower but still normal TSH levels.161 Furthermore, for optimal thyroid function free T3 and free T4
levels should be in the midrange of normal.

Also, other medications that the patient may be given should be taken into account when
prescribing thyroid replacement.

The following medications decrease the absorption of thyroid
medications or increase their excretion102:
• Ferrous sulfate210
• Sucralfate211
• Bile acid sequestrants212
• Calcium carbonate213,214
• Aluminum hydroxide215

• Rifampin224
• Ritonavir225
• Sertraline226
• Cation-exchange resins
• Proton pump inhibitors

• Oral contraceptives
• Clomiphene221
• Metoclopramide219
• Haloperidol216
• Lithium (blocks iodine transport)217
• Amiodarone218
In addition, the following medical conditions are associated with a decrease in absorption of
thyroid medication102:
• Achlorhydria
• Malabsorption syndromes
• Jejunum-ileal bypass surgery
• Short bowel syndrome
• Cirrhosis
Likewise, a high fiber diet and excessive soy intake have also been associated with a decrease in

Pregnenolone
Pregnenolone is the precursor hormone for estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, and cor -
tisol.

The body makes this hormone from cholesterol, and pregnenolone levels decline with age.

By the age of 75 years, most people have 65% less pregnenolone than they had at the age of 35.227
Pregnenolone has a number of functions in the body:
• Blocks the production of acid-forming compounds
• Enhances nerve transmission and memory
• Helps to repair nerve damage
• Improves energy
• Improves sleep
• Increases resistance to stress
• Modulates the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
• Modulates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (which regulate pain control, learn -
ing, memory, and alertness)
• Promotes mood elevation
• Reduces pain and inflammation
• Regulates the balance between excitation and inhibition in the nervous system
Pregnenolone also activates transient receptor potential melastatin-3 (TRPM3), which is a
calcium-permeable ion channel.

TRPM3 is positively coupled to insulin secretion in B cells.

One
study suggested that TRPM3 is functionally relevant in contractile and proliferating phenotypes of
vascular smooth muscle cells, constitutive channel activity, and regulation of cholesterol.

Human
trials need to be done.228
The natural pathways to making pregnenolone are blocked when the patient eats too many satu -
rated fats and intakes trans fats.229 Furthermore, pregnenolone levels tend to decline when the patient 353 Hormones and Their Effects on the Cardiovascular System
is stressed because the body will preferentially convert pregnenolone into cortisol.

Pregnenolone
levels can be measured, and this hormone can be safely replaced in most patients provided that they
do not have a hormonally related cancer.

conclusion
There are many risk factors for heart disease that the practitioner is already aware of such as smok -
ing, high blood pressure, diet, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, family history of early heart dis -
ease, physical inactivity, and stress.

This chapter focuses on a lesser known but very important
risk factor for heart disease, hormonal imbalance.

All of the hormones in this chapter affect heart
function and can be cardioprotective if replaced and balanced appropriately.

TESTOSTERONE AND HEART DISEASE IN MALES: OPPOSING VIEWS AND
A BRIEF LITERATURE REVIEW
introduction
Two recent trials suggest that testosterone replacement therapy in men may increase the risk of heart
disease and/or stroke.231,232
These were poorly designed studies that conflict with numerous previous medical trials that
show the beneficial effects of testosterone on the heart and that low testosterone levels in males are
associated with an increased risk in the development of heart disease.

The following is a comprehensive review of the medical literature on low testosterone being
associated with an increased risk in the development of cardiovascular disease and that testosterone
replacement at appropriate levels not only decreases the risk of heart disease but also can be used
to treat coronary disease.

low testosterone  levels and increased  risK oF Heart disease
Men with coronary heart disease had a significantly lower total testosterone, free testosterone, and
bioavailable testosterone.233
Low endogenous testosterone concentrations are related to mortality due to cardiovascular
disease and other causes.234,235
One investigation showed a possible correlation between lower testosterone levels, erectile
dysfunction, and conditions associated with a higher cardiovascular risk.236
Another study showed that men with coronary heart disease who were under the age of 45 years
had total and free testosterone levels significantly lower than those of controls.237
Serum free testosterone levels were found to be inversely related to carotid IMT and plaque
score.238
Low testosterone levels have been found to be associated with atherosclerosis in men.239
low testosterone  levels and increased  risK oF diabetes  tyPe ii and Metabolic  syndro Me
Low testosterone levels are associated with an increased risk for the development of type II diabetes
and metabolic syndrome.240–244
Because low testosterone has been shown to impact blood sugar levels, the Endocrine Society
now recommends the measurement of testosterone in all male patients with type II diabetes
mellitus.245354 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
low testosterone  levels are associated  witH an increased  risK oF Mortality
Low testosterone predicts mortality from cardiovascular disease.246
Low testosterone levels were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality indepen -
dent of numerous risk factors.

Serum testosterone levels were inversely related to mortality due to
cardiovascular disease and cancer.247
Low endogenous testosterone levels are associated with an increased risk of death from all
causes and cardiovascular death.248
low testosterone  levels and increased  risK oF HyPertension
Low total testosterone concentrations are predictive of hypertension, suggesting total testosterone
as a potential biomarker for increased cardiovascular risk.249
low testosterone  and congestive  Heart Failure
In males with heart failure, low serum androgens were associated with an adverse prognosis.250
In men with chronic heart failure, anabolic hormone depletion is common and deficiency of each
anabolic hormone is an independent marker of poor prognosis.251
testosterone  rePlace Ment and Heart disease
For all-cause mortality, each increase of 6 ng/dl of testosterone per liter of serum was associated
with an almost 14% drop in the risk of death.252
Testosterone replacement was associated with a decrease in HDL-C and lipoprotein(a).253
The mechanism of testosterone replacement decreasing lipids may be due to testosterone’s posi -
tive effects on abdominal fat and insulin resistance.254
Short-term administration of testosterone induces a beneficial effect on exercise-induced myo -
cardial ischemia in men with coronary heart disease.

This effect may be related to a direct coronary-
relaxing effect of testosterone.255
Short-term intracoronary administration of testosterone, at physiological concentrations, induces
coronary artery dilatation and an increase in coronary blood flow in men with established coronary
heart disease.256
Low-dose supplementation with testosterone in men with chronic stable angina reduced exer -
cise-induced myocardial ischemia.257
Testosterone replacement has been shown to increase coronary blood flow in patients with coro -
nary heart disease.258,259
Transdermal testosterone replacement has been shown to improve chronic stable angina by
increasing the angina-free exercise tolerance versus controls that were getting placebos.260
Another study showed that testosterone replacement reduced exercise-induced myocardial
ischemia.261
Testosterone is a coronary vasodilator by functioning as a calcium antagonistic agent.262
Testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadism moderates metabolic components associated
with cardiovascular risk.263
Testosterone replacement has been shown to decrease inflammation and lower total cholesterol.264
Testosterone replacement in patients with congestive heart failure has been shown to improve
exercise capacity, improve insulin resistance, and improve muscle performance.265
Testosterone replacement has been shown to be helpful in patients with severe heart failure.266,267
In this review of the medical literature, one can see that numerous studies have shown that
low testosterone levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease and that testosterone
replacement therapy is associated with a decreased risk of developing heart disease and is even
beneficial in patients who already have coronary vascular disease.355 Hormones and Their Effects on the Cardiovascular System
So, why did the two recent studies (Vigen et al.231 and Finkle et al.232) show that there was an increased
risk of developing heart disease in male patients who were prescribed testosterone replacement therapy?

There are five serious flaws associated with the two recent trials:
Firstly, estrone and estradiol levels were not measured in the subjects in the studies.

High estro -
gen levels in males have been found to be associated with an increased risk in the development of
heart disease and stroke.

Estrogen levels may elevate due to an increase in aromatase activity, altera -
tion in liver function, zinc deficiency, obesity, abuse of alcohol, drug-induced estrogen imbalance,
and ingestion of estrogen-containing foods or environmental estrogens.

HigH estrogens  Are associated  witH an increased  risK oF Heart disease  and stroKe
High estradiol in males was associated with an increased risk of stroke.268
Elevated circulating estradiol is a predictor of progression of carotid artery IMT in middle-aged
men.269
High estradiol levels in men were associated with acute MIs.270
High estrone and low testosterone levels were associated with promoting the development of
atherogenic lipid milieu in men with coronary heart disease.271
Low testosterone and elevated estradiol were associated in this study with lower extremity
peripheral artery disease in older men.272
Men with MI had high estradiol and low testosterone levels.273
Elevated levels of estradiol in men were associated with an increased incidence of strokes, periph -
eral vascular disease, and carotid artery stenosis compared to subjects with lower estradiol levels.274
Elevated levels of estrogen in men are associated with an increased risk of heart disease.275
Secondly, having erythrocytosis is associated with an increased risk in the development of heart
disease and thrombosis.276 A major study on the risk and benefits of testosterone replacement sug -
gests that a baseline hematocrit should be checked at 3 and 6 months and then every 6–12 months.

If the hematocrit is more than 54%, then testosterone therapy should be stopped until the hematocrit
is at a safe level.277 Hematocrit levels were not measured in these two trials.

Thirdly, in both studies not all patients had follow-up testing of testosterone levels.

Therefore,
dosages of testosterone may have been higher than needed.

Supraphysiologial levels of testoster -
one can induce nitric oxide production and cause oxidative stress, which induces endothelial
dysfunction.278
Fourthly, some of the men in these trials were using testosterone injections, which are nonphysi -
ological as they have peak and trough levels over the weekly or biweekly dosing.

This issue was
wonderfully discussed by Cappola in her review of Vigen’s study.279
Lastly, testosterone can convert to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which has been shown to
enhance early atherosclerosis.280 The conclusion of the author of this trial was that the  findings
highlighted a new androgen receptor–/nuclear factor- κB–mediated mechanism for  vascular cell
adhesion  molecule-1 expression and monocyte adhesion operating in male endothelial cells that
may represent an important unrecognized mechanism for the male predisposition to atheroscle -
rosis.

The higher the dose of testosterone prescribed, the more the testosterone  converted by
5α-reductase into DHT.

In these two recent trials (Vigen et al.231 and Finkle et al.232) that suggest
that testosterone replacement increases the risk of heart disease in men, DHT levels were not
measured.

conclusion
Given the plethora of medical studies indicating the beneficial effects of properly prescribed tes -
tosterone, one would have to conclude that these two recent medical trials are poorly designed and
their conclusion is flawed.

Some of the patients did not have repeat testosterone levels measured.

Consequently, the patients may have had supraphysiological levels of testosterone.

In addition, DHT, 356 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
estrone, estradiol, and hematocrit (HCT) levels were not addressed.

Furthermore, the medical lit -
erature has shown that hormones in the body are a symphony and this web of interconnection was
not considered.

16Consequences of
Cardiovascular Drug-Induced
Nutrient Depletion
James B. LaValle
INTRODUCTION
One of the potential challenges facing health-care professionals today is the problem of drug-
induced disease, especially drug-induced nutrient depletion (DIND).

DIND in patients, including
the cardiovascular (CV) patient, is a very important issue that the twenty-first-century clinician
must become well versed in and consider implementing into practice .

With approximately 48% of
people in the United States taking prescription medications (up from 44% in the previous decade),
patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are placed at a much higher risk for developing comor -
bid conditions and for increasing disease pathologies.1 Polypharmacy prescribing is now occurring
in younger and younger populations, so it is becoming increasingly important to assess nutrient
depletion risks as they relate to increased drug side effects, future symptoms, comorbid condition
development, or progression of the underlying disease itself.

In the medical management of individuals with CVD or comorbid conditions, several classes
of prescription drugs may be employed with the potential for depletions of nutrients, which could
induce metabolic changes, and further the progression of any component of the underlying CV
problems or comorbidities.

depletion  of these same medications.

Drugs can inhibit absorption, synthesis, transport, storage,
metabolism, or excretion of essential nutrients.

There are several factors that should be noted
before discussing the relative impact of drug-induced depletions; whether a nutrient depletion
will occur is a complex and multifactorial issue.

Variations in diet, genetic differences, indi -
vidual stress, and activity levels all contribute to the nutrition status of the individual before
drug therapy is administered.

Therefore, responses to drug therapy are highly individualized.

As an example, according to statistics over 22 million patients in the United States take
β-blockers.1 β-Blockers have been reported to reduce the production of melatonin via spe -
cific inhibition of β-1 adrenergic receptors.2,3 Clinically, low levels of melatonin can lead to
sleep disturbances, insulin resistance/impaired glucose tolerance, CV problems, increased CV
events, immune imbalances, and increased oxidative stress and inflammation on various body
systems.4–6
Several placebo-controlled studies have investigated the relationship between β-blocker-induced
central nervous system (CNS) side effects and the nightly urinary excretion of melatonin via the
inhibition of the release of the enzyme serotonin- N-acetyltransferase.7,8 Results report that the CNS
side effects (including sleep disorders and nightmares) during β-blocker therapy are related to a
reduction of melatonin levels.

Nighttime exogenous administration of melatonin as a dietary supple -
ment is reported to reduce the incidence of β-blocker-induced sleep disturbances.8,9
It should be noted that melatonin is also reduced by the administration of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), commonly used in the CV patient with comorbid symptoms of joint/
muscle pain.

A recent cross-sectional, multicenter observational study of osteoarthritis patients
reported that of the over 17,000 patients evaluated over 90% were at an increased risk of gastroin -
testinal (GI) and/or CV risk and that a large percentage of these patients (51%) were treated with
an NSAID + a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) .10 It is of interest that PPI use, with PPIs being the most
frequently prescribed drug in the United States, also is reported to increase the risk of hospitaliza -
tion for a CV event by 51% and individual PPIs each significantly raise that risk as well, ranging
from 39% to 61%.11
Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) is also reported to be depleted by β-blocker therapy.

β-Blocker
use is reported to deplete CoQ10 by interfering with the production of this essential enzyme
for energy production.12 CoQ10 is important in CV function, including the production of cellu -
lar energy (adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) via the electron transport chain.

Depletion of CoQ10
from the body is clinically associated with myopathy (including cardiomyopathy), rhabdomyoly -
sis, hypertension, angina, stroke, cardiac dysrhythmias, fatigue, leg weakness, immune imbal -
ances, neurodegenerative disease, and cognitive decline.13 The use of β-blockers is also reported
to increase the risk of hospitalization in the elderly (45% in those using propranolol) due to
myopathy.14
It is also widely reported that CoQ10 levels are decreased in congestive heart failure (CHF)
patients.15,16 The use of β-blockers, although reported to deplete coenzyme Q10, is considered a
standard of care in those with CHF.

Use of oral CoQ10 is reported to improve functional capacity,
endothelial function, and left ventricular (LV) contractility in CHF without side effects.17 A 2013
meta-analysis reported that CoQ10 supplementation improved ejection fraction (EF) in those with
CHF.18 With the readmission rate of CHF patients within 6 months at approximately 30%–40%,
supplementation with CoQ10 may be an appropriate choice for the clinicians and their patients.19,20
Also, genetic polymorphisms of substrates that metabolize CV medications may lead to specific
nutrient depletions.21 Only variations in vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1)
and CYP2C9 have consistently been associated with drug response (coumarins) that has clinical
implications.

These polymorphisms include the following:
• Cyclooxygenase-1
• Vitamin D reductase complex subunit 1371 Consequences of Cardiovascular Drug-Induced Nutrient Depletion
• CYP2C9
• α-Adducin
• 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase
POTENTIAL NUTRIENT DEPLETIONS: A REVIEW OF SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS
Rather than discussing the individual drugs used in the CV patient that may lead to nutrient depletion,
a review of the principal nutrients depleted, their relationship to CVD and comorbid conditions, and the
associated risks of nutrient depletion will be covered.

Because these are chronic conditions, the drugs
are used long term and patients are on several of these drug therapies for many years.

It is important
to remember that metabolic disturbances build over time with subtle disturbances in enzyme function
leading to a cascade of metabolic disruption.

Very often, patients display symptoms of a nutrient deple -
tion.

Rather than recommending the nutrients that may be depleted, polypharmacy-prescribing habits
are often used, which can mask metabolic problems that have been brought about by drug therapy.

Part of patient management should be assessing the overall nutritional status of the individual.

Part of patient management should be assessing the overall nutritional status of the individual.

In
assessing individuals for possible DINDs, the prescribed medications may have no known nutrient
depletions; but signs and symptoms of nutrient deficiencies should always be assessed, regardless,
because many lifestyle factors such as tobacco smoking and excessive and/or chronic alcohol intake
can also influence nutrient depletions.

Addressing nutritional deficiencies is a foundation to good
health care and in a health-care environment where prevention is increasingly being mandated due
to out of control health-care costs a very cost-efficient way to improve the overall health and well-
being of the patient and to prevent further comorbidities.

Drugs commonly used in the CV patient that have the potential to lead to nutrient depletions are
listed here.

Table 16.1 further illustrates how these medications can affect the patient, with a listing
of the drug’s potential short- and long-term side effects, potential nutrient depletions, and some of
the clinical effects often reported with the loss of one or more of these essential nutrients:
• Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
• Benzodiazepines
• β-Blockers
• Biguanides and sulfonylureas
• Cardiac glycosides
• Centrally acting antihypertensives
• Cholesterol management
• Diuretics (thiazide, loop, potassium sparing, etc.)

• GI management (antiulcer and antacids)
• Pain management (opiates, acetaminophen (APAP), salicylates, and NSAIDs)
• Potassium
MAGNESIUM
Magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body.

It is needed for proper nerve
transmission, production of energy, muscular activity, regulation of temperature, detoxification of
cells, blood pressure regulation, regulation of blood sugar, and regulation of vasospasm, and it helps
with the building of healthy bones and teeth.

Appropriate magnesium levels are especially impor -
tant for the CV patient, and low levels of magnesium are associated with an increased risk of heart
disease.80,81
It is reported that the magnesium intake of approximately 75% of Americans is below the recom -
mended dietary allowance (RDA).82 In addition, many lifestyle factors such as stress and drinking
alcohol can deplete magnesium, so it is easy to understand how with the addition of drug therapy a
clinically significant low magnesium level can occur.

Hypomagnesemia and low dietary intake of magnesium are strongly related to CV risk factors
among known subjects with coronary artery disease, including increasing the proinflammatory/
prooxidant status and an increased risk of ischemic heart disease.83–86 Also, one of the most
significant and least discussed nutrients depleted from first line drug therapy in hypertension is
magnesium.

A Japanese study of over 58,615 healthy men aged 40–79 years that lasted 14.7 years
reported that increasing magnesium in the diet reduced CVD mortality risk by approximately 50%.87
In clinical practice, when patients are prescribed thiazide diuretics for hypertension typically
only potassium depletion is addressed, with patients being advised to drink orange juice or eat
a banana, which are rich sources of potassium.

Often, no education in medical schools or allied
health curriculums is given regarding the potential for magnesium depletion, despite the fact that
many of the listed side effects of thiazide diuretics are also signs and symptoms of magnesium
depletion.

While this topic may be controversial in the literature,88 enough studies have reported
a magnesium-depleting effect from thiazides (one report in 2000 suggested that 20% of thiazide
patients have hypomagnesemia28) to at least justify a screening for magnesium depletion symptoms
among thiazide users.30,89 This is especially true when it is considered that the clinical manifesta -
tions of hypomagnesemia can be so severe.

Deficiency of magnesium is associated with an increased incidence of atherosclerosis, hyperten -
sion, stroke, and myocardial infarction.

Magnesium plays a role in inhibiting platelet aggregation,
blood thinning, blocking calcium reuptake, relaxing blood vessels, and increasing oxygenation of
the heart by improving contractility.

Oral magnesium therapy is reported beneficial in patients
with heart failure, in those undergoing cardiovascular surgery, in hypertensive patients needing
improved endothelial function and in those needing improved myocardial function in general.90–93
It should be mentioned that serum magnesium is a poor measure of magnesium status because
homeostatic mechanisms keep blood levels fairly constant by pulling magnesium from bone and
other body tissues.

It is often suggested that red blood cell (RBC) levels are a more reliable  indicator
of magnesium status.94 However, some researchers state that midnormal magnesium levels could
be indicative of an intracellular depletion.

RBC levels of  magnesium (RBC magnesium) should be
4.2–6.8 mg/dL for most individuals.

Likewise, magnesium levels do not always correspond with
magnesium utilization in the body.

Serum magnesium levels of 1.7–2.2 mg/dL are appropriate for
most individuals.

Even marginal magnesium deficiency can decrease myocardial magnesium, which can directly
affect contractility and excitability of the heart.

The mechanism of action of this result is primarily
by the reduced regulation of calcium ion channel.

Even perfusion of the heart can be easily compro -
mised.

Studies have reported that low magnesium can lead to coronary vasospasm, reduced energy 393 Consequences of Cardiovascular Drug-Induced Nutrient Depletion
metabolism, changes in potassium homeostasis, and excessive induction of free radical genera -
tion.95 In an animal study demonstrating this principle, a diet low in magnesium and high in sucrose
progressively induced elevations in triglycerides and a reduction of insulin binding to erythrocyte
insulin receptors (increased insulin resistance) over a 3-month period.96
Many of the symptoms and conditions that develop, progress, and are prescribed for metabolic
syndrome mimic the symptoms of magnesium depletion, primarily blood pressure regulation and
blood sugar regulation.

It should be noted that several of the listed side effects of thiazide diuretics
are magnesium depletion symptoms, including arrhythmia, lower back pain, mood changes, muscle
pain/weakness/cramps, constipation, headache, and fatigue.

An established potential consequence of long-term use of thiazide diuretics is development of
type II diabetes and because of this their use is controversial in those predisposed to blood glucose
dysregulation.97 Medical literature is clearly establishing the role of magnesium in not only insulin
regulation but also helping to control inflammatory chemistry.98 Drug-induced intracellular deple -
tion of magnesium could be playing a significant role in the rapid induction into the complications of
metabolic syndrome.

The clinical repletion dosage of magnesium as magnesium aspartate, citrate,
or amino acid chelate is 300–800 mg/day.

Larger dosages may induce loose stools, so titrate as
magnesium aspartate, citrate, glycinate or amino acid chelate if needed.

COENZYME Q10 (COQ10)
One of the most frequently discussed depletions in DIND is the area of CoQ10 depletion and the use
of statin (3-hydroxyl -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or HMG CoA reductase
inhibitors) medications.

This depletion can also occur in the use of HMG CoA reductase inhibi -
tors, centrally acting antihypertensive agents, fibrates, diuretics, β-blockers, and second-generation
sulfonylureas and biguanide drug therapies.

It has been demonstrated that CoQ10 concentrations
can fall as much as 54% in patients who are on HMG CoA reductase inhibitor therapy, with a dose-
dependent drop in some patient populations.99 Note that excessive and/or chronic alcohol consump -
tion may also lead to CoQ10 depletion.100
CoQ10 is a cofactor in the electron transport chain, which is involved in cellular respiration and
the generation of ATP.

CoQ10 also plays an important role as an antioxidant and is a principal gene
regulator in muscle tissue and plays a significant role in tissue metabolism.

Clinical manifestations
of CoQ10 depletion can include the following: myalgias, rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, hyper -
tension, angina, stroke, cardiac dysrhythmias, fatigue, leg weakness, decline in immune function,
increase in neurodegenerative diseases, and loss of cognitive function.

In one study, muscle fibers were examined in an elderly population preparing for hip surgery.101
The findings were as follows: CoQ10-treated individuals had a lower proportion of type I (slow
twitch) fibers and a higher concentration of type IIb (fast twitch) fibers compared to age-matched
placebo-treated patients.

This shift is consistent with fiber composition found in younger popula -
tions.

In this study, significant change in gene expression of proteins was noted.

The protective
and regenerative effect of CoQ10 on skeletal muscle is promising, and it may be theorized that low
CoQ10 status could accelerate aging and genetic changes in muscle tissue.

Another area of clinical concern in the metabolic syndrome patient is the increased risk for
Alzheimer’s disease.

Disruption in mitochondrial ATP and an increase in hydrogen peroxide is one
mechanism by which amyloid β-peptide toxicity can take place.

Disruptions in both glucose metab -
olism and increased free radical damage have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s
disease.

In a promising study, isolated brain mitochondria from diabetic rats were treated with
CoQ10.

Treatment with CoQ10 attenuated the decreased oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and
halted the hydrogen peroxide production induced by neurotoxic peptides.

Treatment with CoQ10 attenuated the decreased oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and
halted the hydrogen peroxide production induced by neurotoxic peptides.

This indicates that CoQ10
treatment changed the mitochondrial alterations in the peptide amyloid beta (1-40) , suggesting that
it could play a role in altering the cellular energy deficits correlated to diabetes and the progression
of Alzheimer’s disease.102 These findings suggest that it does not make sense to administer drugs 394 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
that deplete CoQ10 without repletion when clearly mitochondrial energy deficits are involved in the
progression to Alzheimer’s disease.

The value of CoQ10 in hypertension was reported in one clinical trial where supplementing
CoQ10 decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressures, decreased total cholesterol, and increased
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.103 In another trial, supplementation of CoQ10 enabled
hypertensive patients to reduce their medications.

A mean dose of 225 mg in 109 patients led to
discontinuation of one to three medications in 51% of patients within 6 months (average time,
4.4 months); 80% of the individuals had been diagnosed for 9.2 years.

Only 3% required the addition
of one more drug.104 In another study, it was reported that drug-related myopathy, which is a com -
plaint of CoQ10 therapy, was shown to be associated with a mild decrease in CoQ10 without present -
ing a histochemical or mitochondrial myopathy or even morphological evidence of apoptosis in most
patients examined.

The net meaning of this is that significant cellular pathology may not exist and yet
symptom expression could be likely.105 Even though there may be no evidence of changes via creatine
kinase concentrations, metabolic disruption of ATP production and cellular energetics is probable.

With several of the most common drugs used in metabolic syndrome depleting CoQ10 (including
statins, β-blockers, biguanides, sulfonylureas, and thiazide diuretics), clinicians should consider the
implications of chronic mild decreases of CoQ10 and their impact on the progression of the meta -
bolic pathology as it relates to the CV component.

CoQ10 serum optimal reference range greater than 2.5 μg/mL .

Recommended clinical dosage
range for repletion of CoQ10 ranges from 30 to 300 mg/day of a solubilized form of coenzyme Q10.

It should be noted that concomitant administration of CoQ10 supplements with anticoagulants such
as warfarin is reported in several case studies to lead to decreased levels of the anticoagulant.106,107
CoQ10 is chemically similar to the K vitamins, which may explain the interaction with warfarin.

Because of zinc involve -
ment in over 300 enzymatic reactions, the symptoms of deficiency can present itself in a wide array
of physiological dysfunctions.

Conditions and diseases associated with zinc deficiency can include the following:
• Loss of taste and smell
• Poor wound healing
• Anorexia
• Alterations in immunity including cytokine and T killer cell function395 Consequences of Cardiovascular Drug-Induced Nutrient Depletion
• Depression
• Photophobia
• Night blindness
• Frequent infections
• Disorders of skin, hair, and nails
• Arthralgia
• Alteration in hormones including leptin, thyroid, and insulin
• Kidney disease
• Celiac sprue and inflammatory bowel disorders
• Malignant melanoma
• Alcoholism
• Macular degeneration
• Prostate disorders
Zinc is depleted by several medications used in CV treatment, including ARB and ACE inhibi -
tors, statins and bile acid sequestrants, H2 blockers , thiazide, K-sparing and loop diuretics, and
NSAIDs.

One of the more significant findings related to zinc deficiency is the influence on mRNA
and levels of cytokines on cell lines.

Zinc deficiency decreased expression of interleukin (IL)-2 and
interferon (IFN)- γ in the Th1 cell gene expression and upregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- α,
IL-1β, and IL-8 gene expression .108 This study clearly demonstrated the effects of zinc on genetic
expression of cytokines and that the expression was specific to immune cells.

Extrapolated to
humans, this would mean that zinc deficiency could increase the production of TNF- α, IL-1 β, and
IL-8, which is associated with the development of chronic conditions such as CVD, metabolic syn -
drome, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease.109
In addition, it has been shown that increased TNF- α induces insulin resistance and increased
oxidative stress.

Alterations in TNF- α have been associated with decreased HDL, increased low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides, and increases in C-reactive protein.

As insulin resis -
tance is increased by diet, mineral deficiencies including deficiencies of magnesium and chromium,
deficiency of vitamin D, stress, lack of exercise, or other factors, the increase in adipocyte-driven
TNF- α expression could be exacerbated by zinc-deficient chemistry .110 The dosage for repletion of
zinc is 10–50 mg of zinc glycinate daily.

B12/FOLIC ACID
Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) and folate (folic acid) are often discussed together.

While the value
of B12 for reduction of anemia and regulation of DNA and neurologic changes is well understood,
there are specific issues that relate to the depletion of B12 and the progression of metabolic syndrome.

Depletion of folate and B12 can elevate homocysteine levels.

In a trial published in the European
Journal of Endocrinology , folate and B12 therapy was reported to reduce homocysteine levels,
ameliorate insulin resistance, and help resolve endothelial dysfunction in patients with metabolic
syndrome.111 In the treatment group, folate 5 mg and B12 500 mcg/day for 1 month led to striking
results.

There was a reported decrease in homocysteine of 27.8%, significant decrease in insulin
levels along with an improvement in endothelial dysfunction as evidenced by hyperemic vasodilata -
tion of 29.8% and a decrease of dimethylarginine levels by 21.7%.

Plasma homocysteine is clearly
elevated and is used as a biomarker in metabolic syndrome.

It is also an independent marker for
the development of atherosclerotic disease.

Plasma homocysteine is clearly
elevated and is used as a biomarker in metabolic syndrome.

It is also an independent marker for
the development of atherosclerotic disease.

It is thought that folic acid facilitates and restores endo -
thelial nitric oxide by acting as a hydrogen donor and an electron donor to tetrahydrobiopterin and
through the lowering of total homocysteine along with B12 by the enhancement of remethylation.112
Ironically, metformin, commonly used in metabolic syndrome to prevent progression to
type  II diabetes mellitus and hypertension, is reported to deplete vitamin B12 and folate.113,114
A study of 122 patients (59 taking metformin and 63 not taking the drug) reported that metformin 396 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
administration was associated with B12 depletion and an increase in homocysteine and an increase
in peripheral neuropathy symptoms.115 Metformin-treated patients had depressed cobalamin (Cbl)
levels and  elevated fasting methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (Hcy) levels.

Clinical
and electrophysiological measures identified more severe peripheral neuropathy in these patients
with the cumulative metformin dose correlated strongly with these clinical and paraclinical group
differences.

Homocysteine, IL-6, and C-reactive protein can express more dramatically in a 677T  mutation
(methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR]), and this shows that innate immunity is involved
when this cascade of atherosclerosis occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus who are genetically
predisposed .116 Depletion of folic acid from drug therapy in an individual with the 677T  mutation
could accelerate the cascade of elevated homocysteine, increased IL-6, and increased C peptide that
is associated with metabolic syndrome, CVD, and type II diabetes.

In these individuals who are
homozygous for the TT genotype of 677T  (MTHFR), supplementation with  6-methyltetrahydrofolate
(5-MTHF) (1–5 mg daily) may be necessary to overcome genotypic barrier for the absorption of
folic acid.

Depression is a common comorbidity in CVD and in metabolic syndrome.117 Studies are report -
ing low folate levels, low B12, and elevated homocysteine levels that correlated with depression.118,119
Folate and B12 status should be evaluated in CV patients.

The dosage to replenish folate is
400–800 mcg of methylfolate daily.

The dosage to replenish B12 is 500–1500 mcg/day (methylco -
balamin is more readily absorbed and bioavailable with oral administration).

VITAMIN D
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin; it is also called the “sunshine vitamin.” It is estimated that
1  billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency.120
Vitamin D is best known for its regulation, along with parathyroid hormone, of calcium and
phosphorus metabolism.

Vitamin D is primarily produced in the skin from  7-dehydrocholesterol
through solar ultraviolet radiation.121 Additional sources include diet and oral supplementa -
tion.

Independent of source, all vitamin D is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
which is the major circulating form in the blood.

Independent of source, all vitamin D is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D,
which is the major circulating form in the blood.

The kidneys produce the final step to the active
form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Most vitamin D is stored in the body as 25-hydroxyvitamin D
25(OH)-D .121 Vitamin D receptors have been identified in virtually every tissue, including bone/
connective tissues, kidney, heart, adrenal, stomach, liver, skin, breast, pancreatic, immune, brain,
prostate, ovaries, and testes .122 Appropriate levels of vitamin D are necessary for the health
of bones/teeth; CV system, including blood pressure and vascular health; insulin production;
inflammatory balance; immune balance; and mood/cognitive function.123–128
A large study that looked at school children and adolescents in the United States found that
approximately 50.8 million had low levels of vitamin D.129 Age, season, northern latitudes, liver and
kidney function, obesity, poor dietary intake, dark skin tone, and certain medications (corticoste -
roids and phenytoin) all contribute to low vitamin D levels.130397 Consequences of Cardiovascular Drug-Induced Nutrient Depletion
Vitamin D is deposited into fat stores, where it becomes less available for use in the body.

This is
a suggested mechanism leading to insulin resistance.131 Vitamin D also helps to improve immunity
and has anti-inflammatory effects that may indirectly help to improve insulin sensitivity.124 Blood
sugar control in people with type II diabetes has a seasonal variation, being worse in the winter,
which is in part explained by variation in exposure to sunlight and vitamin D levels.132 Research
suggests that low levels of vitamin D may contribute to or be a cause of metabolic syndrome with
associated hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and CVD.133
Research suggests that low levels of vitamin D may contribute to or be a cause of metabolic
syndrome with associated hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.133 In humans, low vita -
min D has been strongly linked to heart and vascular problems including high blood pressure,134
blood vessel problems,135 atherosclerosis, heart attack, and stroke.136–139 In addition, low vitamin D is
linked to death associated with heart problems.140 In a prospective observational study of adults older
than 65 years participating in NHANES III, the risk of death was 45% lower in those with 25(OH)-D
values greater than 40 ng/mL compared with those with values less than 10 ng/mL (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34–0.88).120
Vitamin D deficiency is also linked to poor bone mineral density.141 As stated, vitamin D defi -
ciency is prevalent in the United States, with 60% of nursing home residents and 57% of hospi -
talized patients being vitamin D deficient.142,143 Vitamin D supplementation has been reported to
reduce bone fractures by at least 20% in individuals aged 65 years and older.144 1000–5000 IU
orally of vitamin D3 (25-hydroxyvitamin D) daily may help to improve vitamin D levels.

Optimal
laboratory levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are 30–50 ng/mL.

MELATONIN
Melatonin is an endogenous hormone synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan and secreted
by the pineal gland.

Melatonin is an antioxidant and is involved in the natural diurnal rhythm
of the sleep/wake cycle.

Chronic depletion of melatonin can directly influence daily rhythm of
glucose, reduction in glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) (the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter)
levels, and suppression of insulin secretion.145 The correlation may be that melatonin deficits lead
to disrupted sleep and disrupted sleep can lead to increased insulin resistance.

Melatonin also has
significant antioxidant effects as it stimulates glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase (SOD),
and catalase as well as NO synthase.

Melatonin is reported to reduce oxidative stress in diabetic
populations.

Melatonin is reported to reduce oxidative stress in diabetic
populations.

An evaluation of the NHANES Survey revealed that people who slept 5 hours a night had a 73%
increased risk of becoming obese versus those who slept 7–9 hours per night.146 Trials conducted
at Stanford University found that people who slept an average of <5 hours per night had a 15.5%
decrease in leptin, an increase of 14.9% of ghrelin, and higher body mass indexes (BMIs), regard -
less of the exercise and diet habits of the participants.147 So with loss of sleep, the net effect was
appetite centers were upregulated, BMI was increased, and there was a shift in metabolic dysfunc -
tion toward metabolic syndrome.

When melatonin levels are low, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
cycles are disturbed, leading to increased wakefulness throughout the night, and studies have shown
that administering melatonin in the late evening hours was significantly more effective than placebo
at increasing REM sleep.148,149
Under conditions of high stress, cortisol levels increase, leading to a state of hyperarousal.

Studies are showing that disturbed sleep as a result of hyperarousal can lead to its own effects
on metabolic function (increased TNF- α, increased IL-6, increased visceral fat storage, increased
insulin resistance, etc.

)30 Other nutrient depletions such as reduced magnesium status and low folate
status (decreased serotonin synthesis) can also be simultaneously acting on the sleep center and
inducing hyperarousal.

All of these add up to increase the risk for obesity, diabetes, and CV risk.

Melatonin may enhance insulin-receptor kinase and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 phosphory -
lation, which may improve insulin signaling and may actually counteract TNF- α-induced insulin 398 Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine
resistance in type II and metabolic syndrome populations.89 Lastly, melatonin seems to have a direct
effect on inhibiting tumorigenesis.

Melatonin helps to inhibit cellular proliferation and stimulated
differentiation and apoptosis.90 This is particularly interesting as people with insulin resistance and
sleep disturbances are more prone to cancer due to elevations of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1
and increases in the immunologic shift toward chronic inflammatory chemistry leading to reduced
activity of NK cells.

Because of its potential to disrupt sleep and lead to further problems such as increased appetite,
weight gain, insulin resistance, and increased inflammatory chemistry, melatonin is an important
nutrient to assess and administer if disrupted sleep is present.

Cortisol levels should also be evalu -
ated to determine if steps may be necessary to downregulate cortisol to further address hyper -
arousal as an underlying cause of insomnia.

It is noted that 3–15 mg of melatonin 1 hour before
bedtime can help alleviate the symptoms of insomnia.

CONCLUSION
After reading this chapter, it should be evident that nutrient depletions from many drug thera -
pies used in the CV patient can have a profound effect on the progression of the diseases and the
development of new co-morbidities.

Dysregulation of metabolic pathways should be evaluated to
determine if nutrient depletions could be an underlying cause.

This may help to resolve common
comorbidities in CV patients, including restless leg syndrome, insomnia, low energy or depression,
sexual dysfunction, and weight gain or to determine if medication side effects could be linked to a
nutrient depletion.

Because many of the marginal nutrient deficiencies do not show up on traditional
laboratory tests, the patient is left with another prescription to fill and/or a decreased quality of
life.

Testing for nutrient deficiencies and then providing for these deficiencies in the form of vita -
mins, minerals, and other dietary supplements are relatively inexpensive and can provide significant
margins of safety.

They not only offer a solution to many of the comorbidities but also can reduce
further progression of illness and improve patient quality of life.

As taught in didactic training, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and essential fatty acids are
needed by every cell of the body for proper function and maintenance of homeostasis.

With
depletion or genetic variation, metabolic consequences could lead to the initiation of chronic
illness.

Modern drug therapy and the emerging science of natural therapeutics together provide an
integrative approach to management of chronic diseases as well as the best approach for prevention
and wellness.

Stimulation of angiotensin receptor type 1 (ATR1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and
toll-like receptor (TLR), and direct stimulation of T cells on the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle lead
to immune dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress.

triphosphate, or the amount of chemical energy available to fuel cellular function.

Healthy, normal hearts
contain enough energy to fuel all the cellular functions with a contractile reserve for use in emergency.

Cellular mechanisms used in calcium management and cardiac relaxation require the highest level of
available energy.

Sodium/potassium pumps needed to maintain ion balance are also significant energy
consumers.

The cellular mechanisms associated with contraction require the least amount of cellular energy.

Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in
Cardiovascular MedicineNutritional and Integrative Strategies
in Cardiovascular MedicineDespite 40 years of aggressive pharmaceutical and surgical interventions, coronary artery disease
(CAD) remains the number one killer of women and men in Western civilization.

When it comes to CAD, prevention is easier than cure, and if CAD does present itself, a combination of conventional and alternative methodologies can truly make a difference in people’s lives.

Nutritional and Integrative Strategies in Cardiovascular Medicine  provides scientific and clinical insight
from leaders in the field of cardiovascular medicine who explore an integrative approach to treating and curing cardiovascular diseases through conventional and non-allopathic methodologies.

Nutritional interventions with both appropriate noninflammatory diets and targeted nutraceutical
supports are simple and basic strategies to prevent as well as help manage CAD and congestive heart failure (CHF).

This evidence-based book describes how to integrate nutrition, supplements, lifestyle changes, and medications for improved outcomes in hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, and much more.

Topics include
• Nutrigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in heart disease
• The risks and side effects of statin drugs
• The value of omega-3s and other fats
• Naturopathic approaches
• Gender-specific medicine
• Nutrient-drug interactions in cardiovascular medicine
Nutritional medicine and understanding nutrigenomics for the prevention and treatment of
cardiovascular disease will become the recommended practice of medicine in the very near future.

This book is designed to help established health professionals as well as students preparing for degrees in healthcare.
